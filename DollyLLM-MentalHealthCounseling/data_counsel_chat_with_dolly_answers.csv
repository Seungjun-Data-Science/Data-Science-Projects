   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?",https://counselchat.com/questions/can-i-change-my-feeling-of-being-worthless-to-everyone,depression,"Sherry Katz, LCSWCouples and Family Therapist, LCSW",https://counselchat.com/therapists/sherry-katz-lcsw,"If everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with.Seriously, the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteem.Otherwise, you can go round and round trying to understand why you're not worthless, then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again.There are many inspirational messages you can find in social media.  Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless, and that everyone has a good purpose to their life.Also, since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesn't feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible.Bad feelings are part of living.  They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good.Bad feelings do feel terrible.   Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today.",1,2899,train,"First of all, please seek professional help. It's not healthy to struggle with something like this on your own.

Second, you can start by not focusing on your limitations. Perhaps it's because I'm self-taught but I tend to think that I'm not good at many things. For example, I'm terrible at public speaking, and there's nothing that I can do about it. However, I tend to think that I can't do this, because I can do a lot of other things. The same goes for writing, I'm not good at writing. However, I still think I can still do it. Just keep practicing and you will get better.

Third, try to be grateful. There are many things in life that you can't control, such as death. There's something called 'the law of attrition'. Roughly put, it's the idea that if you keep doing something over and over again, eventually it will become easy. For example, going to the gym regularly will be hard, but eventually it will become a habit.

   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?",https://counselchat.com/questions/can-i-change-my-feeling-of-being-worthless-to-everyone,depression,"Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCCMental Health in a Primary Care Setting",https://counselchat.com/therapists/robin-landwehr-dbh-lpcc-ncc,"Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts  it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it""  which is also a thought that carries some selfcriticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even selfhelp books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 18002738255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC",1,3514,train,"First,  you need to find someone who will listen to you and validate your feelings and thoughts.  Someone who you feel safe sharing your feelings with and who is not related to you.  A family member, friend or therapist can help with this step.

Next,  pray.  Ask for divine intervention.  Become a victim of your own circumstances and circumstances around you.  Find a trusted and effective clergy member to lead you in a prayerful and concrete request for a solution to help you find peace within yourself.  Follow the steps in the prayer, being sure to focus on your request and pray for guidance and peace.  Some common prayer words are ""Help me"" or ""intercede for me"".

Once you have a plan for how to get out of your current situation and feel a sense of control over your thoughts, take steps to execute your plan.  Begin to execute your plan to get out of your current situation.  You will find yourself executing your plan, feeling much better about your self and your situation.

Meditate. While probably not for everyone, meditation is generally considered to be good for clearing your head and focusing your thoughts. It is sometimes confused with relaxation, but meditation has more components of focusing on a subject in your mind.
Exercise. Being active is known to release endorphins, which help reduce stress and anxiety. However, some exercise is better than no exercise. Going for a walk, taking the dog for a walk, doing some Yoga. Find what helps you feel better and do it.
Love yourself. I know this seems like common sense, but love yourself is important, it actually releases feel like endorphins. Also, give yourself rewards like a massage or cooking dinner for your efforts. This is especially important during hard work like cooking. Give yourself breaks.

You can focus on positive qualities or aspects of yourself such as your smarts, ability to make friends easily, your ability to be more calm in difficult situations, etc. Once you think of some qualities, try to focus on those instead of your weaknesses. If you can think of something you like about yourself, focus on that instead of what you dislike about yourself.

It can be easier said than done, but try it and see if you can do it! It's always good to to practice being happy and try to keep that in mind.

We have all felt worthless at one point or another in our lives. It's how you respond to that feeling that defines you.
It's important to take deep breaths and remember that you are not powerless over your situation.
It is very likely that if you spend time thinking about how worthless you feel, that will cause your brain to release ENDORPTION HORMONE, which will in turn make you feel better.
Endorphins are natural pain killers and they are produced in your body during and after a painful activity. 
They are usually too soon named ""acetaminophen"" or ""tylenol"" after the brand names.
They help regulate your body's pain and discomfort in the short term.
Getting a massage will also help release endorphins and help you feel better.
Trying different activities/dogs/plants to help ease your pain, like trying ground turkey instead of beef to lessen the stress in your colon, or laying on a henna tattoo session, would also help get your mind off of your situation.

thoughts on feeling worthless to everyone fall under a heading of thinking
error in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) known as overgeneralization. In CBT
thoughts lead to emotions, so we are going to pick the statement apart and then
reframe it. First list
the evidence that contradicts the thought. Has anyone in the past made positive
comments toward you? This might be hard to recall if we are in a rut, but at
some point in life we frequently have had some positives expressed towards us
by others.  “Everyone” is an absolute. The
specifics on why you are thinking this need to be addressed. How are you
arriving at this conclusion? There may be specific people that we want more
validation from. Or specific people might have made offhand hurtful comments, (such

and think that everyone thinks I am worthless, that thought is not rooted in
facts.

the Pros and Cons of thinking this way? What are the Benefits and Costs? There

continue to tear you down and make you feel bad. So can we reframe the thought
about the situation? Is there another way of looking at the situation? Again,

You have to do something to combat this feeling of being worthless.  You can't keep thinking like this, and that's exactly what you're doing. So the only option is to do something about it.  

The first step towards changing your mindset is to take a step back and realize that you're not in control of everything.  You can only control what you can see, and what you can change.   So next you need to take a look at the things you can see that are causing you to think this way, and change them.  

So you have to understand that everyone is not going to think the way you want them to.  So that you can accept this fact.  So your next steps will be to accept that everyone else is different, and make your own decisions based on this.  Understand that you are not alone, and there are many others who feel this way too.

Let me see if I can guide you in the right direction. Often when I talk to my clients about feelings of worthlessness we start with a little bit of selfexploration. We start with noticing. Start to notice when these feelings come up for you. Is there a particular time
of day, a specific person who brings it out, a phrase you hear? Just
start to notice. Usually it's tied to something but it may take a while to figure out what that something/someone is. Try to be patient.Next we start to explore. When did these feelings start? Where do you think they come from? Is there something  a statement  perhaps that repeats in your head over and over again? If so, whose voice is it? These are difficult questions, and just a few of them, so take your time answering them. (We usually do it over a few sessions.) It might even be helpful to write them down somewhere. If you have a journal that would be a great place as research has shown that our brain works differently when we put pen to paper versus typing on a computer. Now comes the good news. Our brains are able to rewire themselves. This allows us to change habits we don't want as well as statements we say to ourselves that are no longer serving us. The next step is to select an ally. Someone who is or has been in your corner, someone who is always rooting for you. If you don't have someone like that, that's ok  a lot of us don't  you can just make someone up. Close your eyes and try to describe that person in great detail from the way they look to the way they act to the way they sound. Now, pick a phrase you would like that person to say to you whenever you start to think that you're worthless. Something that will help you feel better about yourself  a characteristic, a skill, a great joke you tell, a physical attribute. This also takes time and may involve you asking for help from someone who knows you.Once you have all of that together  the noticing, answers from where these feelings and statement(s) come from, your ally, your new statement, you can try to put it altogether. When the feelings come up, notice what is bringing them up and then call upon your ally to try to change the statement in your head from the selfdefeating one to the more positive, uplifting one. I hope this was helpful. Again, I do this with my clients over quite a few weeks, if not months, and I am there with them the whole time. It is quite an involved process and can bring up a lot of very difficult feeling/memories. If at any point you find it too hard to go at alone, please seek help. If you take anything away from this reply, know that there is help out there and that it is possible to change the way you feel.",0,105,train,"There are a lot of things that you can do to help yourself overcome feelings of worthlessness.

1) Get plenty of rest. Studies show that lack of sleep can cause changes in the levels of certain neurotransmitters, which can increase the likelihood of impulsivity. The brain doesn't need much rest to do its work effectively, so make sure you give yourself enough time to sleep and recharge.

2) Talk to someone who can listen. Being able to talk to someone who can provide non-judgmental and understanding feedback can help. Find someone who's familiar with your situation and who doesn't have a conflict of interest (e.g. a friend who's jealous of your relationship with yourself). You could also talk to a mental health professional (e.g. a therapist).

3) Look for ways to experience pleasant feelings. Find activities that make you feel happy or that allow you to take pleasure in the world around you. Being able to find things to be happy about in your life can help offset negative feelings."

In fact, most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected. In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care. Basically, it’s like a road map of where you want to go, how are you going to get there, looking at stopovers, some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic, however, necessary. Of course, these plans can also change due to internal (what we have control over like our thoughts, feelings and behaviours) or external reasons (those things that are outside our control).

In fact, it is likely that you do not have enough issues. People who suffer from a myriad of issues, such as you, typically need a wider scope of counseling and not just individual counseling.

Additionally, you will likely uncover the various contributors to your current feelings of anxiety and depression. This may include past traumas, relationships, etc. Even when therapy does not fully fix the causes of your issues it is likely that the multiple issues you suffer from become less noticeable due to the overall improvement in your emotional and psychological well being."

""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice selfcare exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your selfesteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!",0,82,train,"That really depends on your personal philosophy on what should be addressed in counseling. If you see counseling as an effective way to manage your issues, then by all means, seek out professional counseling and address all of your issues. 
On the other hand, if you see counseling as something that is causing additional issues for you and doesn’t want to add to those issues, then perhaps it is best you not pursue counseling. Asking a loved one to shoulder even more of your burden is not advisable and could be harmful to your emotional well-being. However, this is ultimately a personal decision you should make with the guidance of a professional."

You might also filter out obvious and fixable problems like anxiety and focus on more existential ones. How do you perceive yourself? What is perceived as an issue may not be to you. That said, I would still recommend talking to a counselor about what issues you really have. It will not be a comfortable conversation and it might feel like you’re setting yourself up for failure, but talk is talk and learn is learn. You’re not the only one who has issues.

Anxiety often causes folks to be self conscious about their appearance, mannerisms, or emotions. Anxiety can make you look at things more critically, perhaps even negatively, which can lead to additional feelings of shame.

There is a lot of anxiety in going to counseling for the first time.  This is normal.  In answer to your  question, the answer is an absolute NO!  An important thing to remember about getting counseling is that it is a courageous first step towards hope and healing.  Getting help is like training to run a marathon, it is not a sprint.  You have shared a lot of issues that you are dealing with from your past, that are now negatively impacting your present, but I believe that in getting the right kind of help and support, none of them are impossible to overcome.  Part of the therapeutic process is defining and prioritizing therapy goals.  In collaboration with you, as a client, a therapist is there to help you with this process in determining what you would like to work on first.  Not getting counseling, based on the history you have shared, has the potential to put you more at risk for mental and physical health issues.  You are already seeing this happen as you begin to experience new symptoms, namely your anxiety.  In therapy, you will gain understanding and insight, as well as learn skills and strategies to manage the symptoms you are experiencing.In conclusion, I would encourage you to reach out to a licensed counselor who has experience in treating trauma, grief/loss and will address shame.

Best of luck to you!",0,98,train,"Definitely not! It’s important to make sure you’re addressing your full array of issues by incorporating both formal and informal counseling into your treatment plan. Formal counseling can be just as important as diet and exercise when it comes to improving your mental health, and it can also help you tackle underlying problems that might be affecting your mental health without you even realizing it.

Informal counseling can help you manage cravings for unhealthy foods or activities, or give you another chance to vent about something you’ve been holding back. Informal counseling can help you stay connected to your faith, manage your medications or manage daily life stress. Informal counseling can also help you figure out ways to cope with important life milestones like a graduation or a wedding. Informal counseling can be equally as important as formal counseling in improving your mental health.

Combined, you can use your treatment to address the root causes of your underlying problems, improve your diet, exercise, and stress management, improve your mental health, and help you handle stressful life events better. You’re not limited to just counseling, but formal and informal counseling is a great way to approach a successful treatment for any mental health concern."

My suggestion is to seek out treatment from a trained therapist. I cannot diagnose you, but it would be helpful to know what kind of treatment is being sought. For example, anxiety treatment may focus on understanding your triggers, while another therapist may work with a different treatment model.

Finding out the cause of depression/anxiety isn't always as straightforward as it seems, since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific trigger/reason. For example, if I am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life, then I start seeing life through this lens of feeling down, and typically I'll start to see a lot more that I get down about, and it can really build very quickly on itself. Same with anxiety. Obviously, this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained, but that's where working with a counselor/therapist comes in. I would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic, and if you can (through the panic attack) continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations. Even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you're feeling  such as saying to yourself ""Okay, I'm breathing really rapidly, and my heart is racing, now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight..."" Reminding yourself that it's just your body's reaction to stress, and while it might be overreacting right now, you're okay and eventually it will go away.

First, make sure you are not coming down with a more serious condition, such as pneumonia or the flu. You can also ask your health care provider for advice. If you suspect that this may be depression, it is important to remember that this does not cause the feelings you are experiencing. Instead, it is a condition that is causing you to feel this way, and in this case, a lack of certain chemicals in your brain. In order to feel better, you need to get more of these chemicals into your system. To this end, I would recommend getting some sunshine and moving. Getting some exercise helps release stress hormones, and also helps get your mind moving. This can be difficult when you are feeling stuck in your feelings, but it can be done! And lastly, I would encourage you to look into methods for getting more of the chemicals you need into your system. Certain medications can be available without a prescription, but it is important to speak with your doctor about this process."

Meditation...Breaks Anxious Thought PatternsA common symptom of anxiety is having racing negative and obsessive thoughts that create a vicious cycle of worry within your mind. Meditation can reduce rumination and the break negative thought patterns by increasing your control over random unwanted thoughts and decreasing your tendency to worry by altering the way your brain responds to stress. For example, instead of following your negative thought down the rabbit hole, you learn to view your thoughts differently and recognize it for what it is – a thought – and let it go. Thank goodness to neuroplasticity and your brains endless capacity to change! Balances Brain ChemicalsAnxiety is brought on by various factors (personality type, emotional trauma, genes, prolonged exposure to stress...) and sometimes causes an imbalance of chemicals within the brain (GABA and serotonin). A meditation practice can assist in restoring the balance of neurotransmitters within the brain by increasing GABA (neurotransmitter connected to feeling happy and relaxed) and serotonin (another neurotransmitter connected to being happy) and decreasing cortisol (stress hormone).Builds A Healthier BrainBased on research and scans, individuals who have a regular meditation practice show dramatically larger amounts of gray matter, the volume of the hippocampus, thickness of the cortex, increased blood flow to the brain, improved neural connections between various parts of the brain and decreased size of the amygdala (controls autonomic responses associated with fear, arousal, and emotional stimulation).

It's possible that there are at least some contributing factors, even if they are  as a result of hormonal fluctuations.For example, at the start of your period, do you have that ""I feel great"" feeling, or are you tired and down?  Midcycle (assuming your periods are regular), do you find yourself napping or ready to run a race?  Either way, how you feel may be leading you to behaviors that contribute to your changes in energy and optimism. Let's say that the few days before your period, you feel cranky, bloated and want salty food.  Your natural inclination might be to isolate, stay inside and eat chips.  The next day, you feel even more tired, cranky and bloated.  It STARTS with a hormonal symptom, but what you do with that can change how you  end up feeling.  So if you notice feeling cranky, bloated and craving salt, what if you pull up a restorative yoga video online, spend an hour being restful and centered in your body and have a good meal with a healthy balance of fats, proteins and carbs, with fresh veggies and fruits before you turn in early to give your body the rest it is asking for ?

Christiane Northrup, MD, likens our menstrual cycle to the tide.  When the tide is out (just before your period), you see all the garbage cluttering up your ocean floor, but you don't have the energy to address it, so there it stays, bugging you.  At the height of physical and emotional energy (usually midcycle/ovulation), the tide is back in and you don't see all that annoying stuff you saw before.  Since you have good energy at this time, take advantage of it by doing some ""clean up"" on the things you saw there when you felt crummy.  Maybe it's that conversation you have been putting  off with your partner, or having the longdelayed closet clean out, or searching for a job that feels/pays/fits you better.  Whatever it is, those ""PMS blues"" may hold important messages for you.If taking good care of yourself, staying tuned in to your needs and keeping an eye on the ""tides"" don't help, then  see your doctor.

According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this.  When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better.  If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior.  Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences.  Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.   Someone who is trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy and/or Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you.",4,286,val,"That's completely normal.

Winter depression (seasonal affective) is something that affects a lot of people both people who also deal with other kinds of depression that happens to get worse in the winter as well as people who just deal with depression in the winter. Light affects how our bodies release and absorb neurotransmitters such as serotonin and most believe that a major contributing factor for winter depression is that we get less light when it is colder outside and darker outside. Exposure to light can make a big difference. If you are someone who is awake during the day (not someone who works the night shift :) )one simple change you can make is keeping your curtains in your bedroom light enough as to let some light in in the morning. This will give you light right off the start of the day and can make it easier to get going in the morning. Beyond this, keeping windows cleared from blinds so that you get that natural light or even taking a short 10 or 15 minute walk each day can get you both light and exercise to help fight off the depression. Outside this, as others have suggested a light box is a popular method of warding off the depression however some of these may expose you to UV light and so this is something to check in with both with the light box manufacturer and with your doctor to make sure you have a good understanding of the risks and benefits for that.

ice. The elements along with wind, windchill and severely cold temperatures may
lead to feelings of sadness, anxiety, and low energy. For some people these
symptoms occur each year from late fall to early spring and may be suffering
from a condition known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Whether you have
been diagnosed with SAD or are finding yourself struggling with the “winter
blues” for the first time here are some suggestions for feeling better and
staying healthy.1. Nutrition Most likely you have
heard the term “comfort food.” These foods and snacks are high in
carbohydrates, sugar and fat. Avoid overeating cookies, cakes and candy. Chose
vegetables, fruit and protein for snacks and plan balanced meals. If you find
yourself wanting to eat or snack throughout the day, ask yourself why you are
eating. Are you hungry? Or Are you eating because you are bored?2. AlcoholKeep in mind that alcohol is a depressant so consuming wine,
beer or liquor when already feeling sad, anxious or depressed will only add to
your symptoms. Do not consume alcohol while engaging in outdoor activities such
as snow removal, skiing, or ice fishing. If you find yourself reaching for an
additional glass of wine or beer be mindful and ask whether you are doing it
due to boredom. Instead of mindlessly taking another glass of alcohol, drink a
glass of water. 3. SunlightGet
out in the sunlight or brightly lit spaces, especially early in the day.4. Be activeIf you are unable to go to your favorite gym, exercise class
or go for a run, find a way to stay active in your home. There are a lot of
short, instructional programs available on YouTube that you can follow to do
some gently yoga, dance, or do strengthening exercises using only your body
weight.5.  Reach out for help
Confide in someone you trust about how you are feeling. Do
not hesitate to contact a counselor if you feel that you are becoming more
depressed and anxious. If you experience thoughts of suicide call the National
Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 18002738255.",0,27,train,"First of all, there is no way to predict the weather. Second, the important thing is not to take anything personally.

If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot.  Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to ""take care of everything"" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own.  You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you.  If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to recreate this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this ""self sacrifice at the expense of others"" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/peoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self.

You work hard at it, and soon enough you have realized that you became addicted to it, and that you are neglecting other areas of your life. A cycle breaker is really hard, but it is possible. The important thing is to not become paralyzed by fear, and stay honest with yourself about what you need. For example, you may realize that spending every moment of your free time playing online games might not lead you to a fulfilling life. On the other hand, starting a company that is close to your heart, but which doesn't provide you with a steady income is also a cycle breaker. It requires dedication and sacrifices. In the end, you will be glad that you did it, because it will bring you closer to what matters to you the most."

Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now.

- try to find someone else to stay with her. Some people recommend creating a shared meal plan where she could stay for at least a week and then check whether she realizes what a huge change this will be for both of you.

This leads to two questions: 1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor, and 2) What is the right approach?1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor? The right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The indepth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their inthemoment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' 2) What is the right approach?  As Carl Jung stated, ""When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or

Selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. Taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. Here are a few reasons for this: 1. Making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder. To come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor would consult the DSM, but they may also use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. Many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. Our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. We really can't be objective. Something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. In addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. Sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes selfdiagnoses impossible, in and of itself. For example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. That would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. There a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. There are other reasons, but these are three important ones. Now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? Maybe not. You may be correct. But, it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. If a disorder is then found, you can begin to talk about treatment. Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

Create a video chat. This can be a great way to stay connected with friends that are in different states, and you can be a ""party chat"" if you want.

Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. When they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution. In fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can  be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC",0,107,train,"Thank you for your inquiry.  It is good that you are looking for solutions.  Depression is a mental health issue that impacts quality of life and causes suffering.  Learning how to manage your thoughts and moods can help reduce the frequency of depression.  One strategy that has helped me is to follow gratitude practice.  When I am feeling down, I try to identify a difficulty I am having and focus on what I am grateful for.  This is a very effective way to manage your mind and get things back on track."

It's a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help. And there are therapists everywhere (there are even therapists online, so you don't have to be that close to them or their office.)There are several sites that I refer people to to begin the process of looking for a therapist. I usually have them start with psychologytoday.com. Once there (there is a therapist directory), you can narrow choices down by ages that they work with, insurance they accept, depression as an issue they focus in, etc. You can also narrow down by therapist's modality, but that can get complicated if you aren't too familiar with the various theoretical approaches. It's important that you find someone that you feel understands your situation. That might mean that they identify an issue you are having in their profile, or on their professional website. But, you should try to meet a couple of different therapists if you aren't quite sure. It can be challenging that first session, but your best (note, not ""THE best"") therapist will help you feel comfortable (or as comfortable as possible, given therapy can be uncomfortable especially at first) and understood from the getgo.I have found that asking friends or family for names and recommendations Is also a common way to find a therapist, because it can come from a trusted referral source. But remember that we are all different, so what works for one might not always be a good fit. And again, it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit (sometimes, it can take a few sessions.)

Many people struggle with both anxiety and depression, so trying to talk to a stranger about your anxiety might not be the best solution. However, many people find that talking to a stranger about their anxiety helps them understand that feeling better.

If neither of those options are helping, try asking a close friend or family member for help getting started. A good place to start is to find ways to express how you're feeling, such as by writing down your feelings and sharing them with your friend or family member. It can also be helpful to think about ways you've felt loved and cared for in your life. Once you can start sharing some of these feelings with your friend or family member, you can ask them more pointed questions to help you explore your experience. It can also be helpful to read books and educational materials about depression, anxiety, and mental health in general so you have more background to help guide your exploration of these questions."

more than just those two symptoms, but there are more mild forms of depression

Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future.",0,42,train,"I wouldn't say you're depressed. Your reaction seems natural, they are not the first people to react in the way you describe.

You say that you live with your dad, which may have an influence on your relationship with the outside world, but that also means that you have access to an unlimited number of emotional support from your family, as you can share your feelings with them without worrying about the consequence on your relationship with your friends.

I would suggest taking a step back and try to understand the circumstances, why do you feel like that you're never going to do anything right, are you one of those people that talk too much, are you just going through the flu, maybe you should seek help from a professional.

It's definitely worth mentioning though, that one of the best parts of social media is that we have an unlimited access to information about everything, and this is how it seems like you are so often discouraged.

All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future.

I'm not an expert on being a father, but here are my thoughts.

I would suggest to spend less time watching movies/tv and more time being physically active (walking, playing sports, running errands, yard work). Spending time with friends would also help. Have him join a sport or take him to a movie and introduce him to the concept of paying for things/acquiring social cues.

I'm not sure if his negative attitude is stemming from boredom/anticipation or if it's from his real feelings. I'd suggest to check into this and try to understand. This could also help to know more about his feelings/emotions (e.g., his parents' relationship, your relationship with your mom/dad, etc).

Good luck!"

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process. You do not have to deal with it alone. Dr. Virginia Chow, Montreal Psychologist.

Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion.  There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion.  When we overgeneralize, we use words like ""always"" or ""never"" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious?

It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-do-i-make-myself-happy-without-someone-who-made-me-happy,depression,"Shawn Thomas Berthel, M.S., LMHCStep into your new life path.",https://counselchat.com/therapists/shawn-thomas-berthel-m-s-lmhc,"Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote selfcare. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.",0,93,train,"Here’s what helped me:
1. Take care of my health. Cut down on sugar and alcohol. Go to the gym.
2. Cut down on video games. I used to play tons of video games but I found that making myself productive resulted in more of a feeling of accomplishment and not just twiddling my thumbs.
3. Get a pet. Growing a pet and making it feel loved will fill a similar emotional void as having your loved one back. 

My advice is:
1. Don’t compare yourself to the people who made you happy. Be happy for what you have.
2. Focus on what you can control. One of the reasons your friends and family may have drifted away is that you weren’t able to keep up communication and didn’t feel like you had a say in what was important to you. Now you have the opportunity to prioritize your own wants and needs and they’ll hopefully return.
3. Enjoy the little things. Finding joy in the small things in life (eating a chocolate bar instead of a caramel one; going out for breakfast every weekend) will help carry you through when life isn’t feeling exactly how you want it to."

It sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly. Part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world, almost as if it is trapped inside of your body. Many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts, emotional numbness, difficulty expressing themselves, and bodily tension (caged animal?). In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through, the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression, and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedom.",2,208,train,"This is extremely common. Most people feel like caged animals at some point in their life. This is because our brains were built to help us survive, and, thus, they are hardwired to pay attention to threat and to be sensitive to discomfort. This is why many animals will let you pet them when they are feeling comfortable, but will have a reserved attitude toward you when they feel threatened.

Often times, we need to identify what is creating the discomfort in order to work to fix it. In your case, you feel like you are caged because you are working too hard. You could look into ways that you could work less or adopt better habits. Having someone nearby to talk to will help a lot. You could find a rehab like program for your work environment. You could also consider looking into mindfulness, meditation, or self-help books to help you with the work you are doing."

When you're stressed you often activate a default mode which is a deep rumination on the problem that triggers cortisol release. Try reducing this type of ruminating by getting a good night's sleep, avoiding television and computers for awhile, getting outside for fresh air, going for a walk, or seeing a therapist for neurofeedback. There may be other factors at play like your diet or stress at home. I would recommend looking into this."

While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a nonemotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible.

Having older parents can certainly pose challenges. Most kids feel like their parents don't understand them, but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers. They're from a completely different generation than you are. It sounds like they love you, but may not understand you. The problem here is the generation/age gap, and there's not a whole lot you can do about that. What you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently. It seems like you're looking for affirmation from them, looking for their approval and understanding. It's never a good idea to look to others to define who you are or to get a selfesteem boost.

Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents weren’t listening to me. It’s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in. Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we didn’t, none of us would be living. Anxiety & stress keep us on our toes! Often, I have to remind myself of this as well. However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives. Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as: deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety. Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that sounds silly. But, it’s true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. Imagine being in the Doctor’s office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and/or stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards. Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be “in the moment” and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your “happy place.” Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it! Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students. Lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue. I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best!",0,334,train,"You're absolutely right that your parents don't always help you with your problems when you need help.

It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued. In working with a therapist, you may be able to get some clarity about your past, who you are, and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships, so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you.",1,98,train,"One of the best things you can do for someone who is struggling with a difficult relationship with a parental figure is to use the therapeutic relationship they create with you to communicate with them openly about their feelings. Many people have resentments, feelings of abandonment, or other wounds from the relationship that are not immediately obvious to those who experienced the relationship. This is normal. It takes time for the brain to process the impact of traumatic experiences, and it can be helpful to discuss what happened with those who experienced it to help access feelings of loss or mistrust. While many of these people will try to protect you from knowing more than you need to know, it is also useful for you to know these things to help you understand them and support them. Supporting the person, rather than just getting mad at them, requires not only understanding the history, but also the ability to imagine what it is like to grow up in the situation.

It is also helpful to think of it in terms of the overall goals of therapy. Therapy helps the individual gain skills to manage emotions. One way this is accomplished is through the therapeutic relationship. Without it, individuals might be overwhelmed by feelings of uncertainty about the future. This could also lead to efforts to fill the gap with unrealistic expectations of the future."

Adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. We carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. This is often easier said than done, but it is possible. From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us  however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed. Those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions  even in the worst of cases. They themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. How are they behaving toward you now? Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. By forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. Talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC",0,57,train,"I'm sorry you've experienced this sort of thing.

There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with selfcare sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression  feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exerciseeven when you don't feel like it healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make shortterm goals and get some support.

213,213,213,52,I need help coping with depression as a result of stress,"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.",https://counselchat.com/questions/i-need-help-coping-with-depression-as-a-result-of-stress,depression,Cimberly R.

Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage.  Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress.  When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.",0,68,train,"Hi,
It's great that you sought help for your stress problem. I think it's great that you are taking steps towards improving your coping skills. I encourage you to read through tips and strategies to stress management and hope that you find one that works well for you.
Also, I think it's good to mention that one of the reason you felt depressed is because it felt like there wasn't a solution to your problem and this led you to feel depressed. In order to get over stress, it's necessary that you try to see it from a different perspective and that you come up with solutions to your problems. For instance, you can seek help from someone more experienced than you are in that area, find someone to talk to, join online forums to discuss your problem or keep yourself busy with activities that distract you from your thoughts.
Please feel free to ask any questions that you might have and I look forward to hearing back from you."

When I was going through a similar breakup, I really wished there was an app that could give you a sense of what other people who have gone through the same situation were feeling. There's not, but I wish there was. Maybe you could ask people on social media what they wish there was an app for.

I would talk to your health insurance about getting mental health coverage. They may have a limit on how much they'll cover, but I think that you could probably find a psychiatrist in your area that would be willing to see you at a discounted rate. Or maybe you could find someone that you could see at your regular rate and just talk to them? I'm not a mental health professional, so I can't really offer more suggestions there.

I would also see if you could find a support group for people going through this. Maybe there is a mutual friend, neighbor, or co-worker that you could talk to. You could ask them if they"

This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get followup care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.  So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 911 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 18002738255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J.

And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer.

It’s wonderful that you want to support your husband, but If your husband is feeling depressed and hopeless, you can best help him by getting him to a mental health professional. Feelings of hopelessness and depression, and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts. With a mental health professional, or in the emergency room of a hospital, your husband should be evaluated for suicidal thoughts, intent and plan, and if he is a danger to himself he should probably be hospitalized again until he is stable. Without knowing the particulars, your husband may suffer from Major Depressive Disorder or some other illness on the depressive spectrum.

But it is also important of being aware of your emotions.  How are you feeling after the suicide attempt?  It is common to experience negative feelings while you try to make sense of the incident.  Feelings like anger, shame, guilt and fear are frequent; while, wanting to avoid, minimize and become distant from the person are parts of the defense mechanism to attempt a quick resolution.  Once you understand and overcome those feelings you may be in a better position to help your husband; who may be experiencing some negative feelings as well.First, it is important to have a safety plan in place, which includes removing harming objects from the home, knowing who to call if there’s a new attempt (either 911, or nearby treatment center), have a professional expert who monitors you and your husband’s progress, either a Counselor or mental health provider could help you manage negative feelings and identify ways to handle triggering situations.Once the safety plan is in place,  make him feel supported and not judged, saying open ended statements, like: “I am glad that you are here, please let me know what I can do to help you through this process”.  Making small changes toward a healthier living may help as well.  Exercising, eating healthier and practicing new leisure activities may be good ways to start.  Also, explore your spirituality and your husbands, looking for ways to encourage each other by joining a support group or finding people who share your spiritual beliefs.If you have more questions or concerns I offer teletherapy in the State of Texas, and traditional Counseling in Puerto Rico, call 7874665478. ¿Cómo puedo ayudar a mi esposo después de un intento de suicidio?Después de que el llego a casa del hospital estaba enojado, luego por un tiempo maravilloso.

It is likely that he was feeling self-conscious about his appearance and the interventions required to care for his new life. This in turn likely led to frustration that further tests and interventions were required. He may also have been worried about how the hospital staff would treat his wife now that he was back home and away from the stimulation and distraction of the hospital. He may also have been frustrated by his new sonogram results that told him he was having a boy. These stresses may have combined to increase his already elevated stress hormone levels, which in turn likely led to his current state of mind."

Let's make change happen.,https://counselchat.com/therapists/samara-perez,"You are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression: low self esteem, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, sad mood, feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness. A full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that ""Do you think you are depressed?"" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . I'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy.  It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv.  I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time.  I hope you find this information helpful.

Fortunately, your insurance might be able to help cover some of your mental health needs, which is a good first step. You can check with your insurance provider about this, and if it turns out they can cover what you need, they might be able to refer you to local resources that could help you manage your depression. If this does not work, you might want to consider trying to access resources on your own to help manage your depression. You might also talk to a therapist about some of your concerns.

I would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you. Also, most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done, but after that, the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping. If something is or is not working, communicate this with your therapist. This is a big deal. Most therapists I know actually welcome this feedback.There is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance (the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy) is very important.

Additionally, it would be helpful to take stock of your emotional needs. Sometimes meeting goals requires a certain amount of energy or resources to be exerted. If you have trouble mustering up the will power to do so, it could be helpful to ask for help from friends, family, or a therapist to figure out what it is you need in order to meet your goals.

The decision could be whether or not stay together or it could be any number of other things, such as what state to live in.When you ask whether you have to respect whatever decision he makes, respecting his decision does not mean that you have to agree with what he decides.

Sometimes when I'm working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety, I ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds. ""What are the worst thoughts that run through your head?"". Often they struggle, perhaps out of shame; maybe they don't want me to know their worst thoughts. But I can help them better if I do know, because then we have a place to work from. You are feeling hopeless and worthless, and your thoughts support these intense emotions. I don't know you, but I strongly believe that you have someone in your life who, if they heard your thoughts, would say ""That's not true. I know where her value is."" I believe that there are people who would see your value clearly, even if in small things. Can you imagine those voices?You mentioned God, so let's invite God into the conversation. What might God say to you? What evidence might God...who sees all..have of your worth? What hint might God give you about your purpose? You suffer from severe anxiety, and the agoraphobia works together with fear; they're a tag team. Fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you (or something equally bad), and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth. Do you see their plan? Make her scared... keep her here alone...convince her it's hopeless. They both try to convince you that they are your only friends, except they're lying to you. They only want power over you.You forget your worth. You forget that we all have worth. No one is a waste. I believe all God's creatures have worth, and that we're here to use our gifts to improve the world, and to remind each other of our value. There are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs. Can you find them? My guess is you've been alone and isolated for a very long time and it's impossible for you to see your worth in this situation. We need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors. We see our value in their eyes. Do you remember the first time you questioned your worth? What was happening that you blamed yourself for? Can you speak to that child and tell her (or him) that whatever's happening isn't her fault? It's that child who cannot see her own worth, probably because someone treated her as though she had none. That's only a story though; not the truth. Can you find another thread of a story? Who might tell a story of your worth?Oak Harbor, I believe that there is help closer than you think. Fear wants you to believe it's hopeless. You reached out here...can you reach out again? Start with just one person, and that will lead you to somewhere. We don't know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone? You've stopped living. You can choose any moment to start. I wish you peace and hope. :)",0,101,train,"You serve a purpose. You are needed and loved. God allows your suffering in order to lead you to Himself. When you are honest with God, He acknowledges that you are in pain, and He listens intently to your plea for help. As you communicate with God and receive His love, you begin to experience a deep release of emotional pain that is honest and real. You can see the difference you make in someone's life when you're in your element, and when you are deeply loved and needed, you feel the absence of that deep, knowing that you are needed leads to a yearning for more love and that feeling of loneliness. And so you keep trying, and your suffering leads to more suffering and deeper release. You try to do more, and so you keep the wheel turning, your efforts leading to more release and more suffering until you are exhausted. You live the life of a burden, struggling against your own limitations and knowing that you are loved and needed by someone, just not necessarily in a deep way. You keep trying to fill the hole in your soul, and the more you try to fill that hole the deeper it gets until you just explode in agony, knowing that you are an empty vessel waiting to be filled, and the only way to fill"

First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it.

Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful, but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions. Without knowing your location, I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline.

Your other concerns, though, seem pretty ""normal"" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics  because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved.

It certainly sounds like you don't like how things are going. Here are a few thoughts and ideas:1. If you haven't seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesn't hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, don't be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are ""normal."" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are ""abnormal"" it doesn't mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember, the symptoms are the problem, not YOU.

Why do I feel so alone?",https://counselchat.com/questions/why-have-i-been-feeling-empty-lately,depression,Locke Curfman,https://counselchat.com/therapists/locke-curfman,"It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal.  Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief.  When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result.  In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue.  Having ""a lot on my mind"" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with ""emptiness.""  In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having ""a lot on my mind"" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening?  Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate?  Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism? We can feel ""alone"" even when in a crow of people or at a party.  This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves.  If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, ""You are worth nothing"" or ""You don't deserve the company of others"" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma.  Looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.",1,158,train,"It can be really hard to feel alone in this day and age.

Si has sido víctima de un trauma que tal vez no estás listo(a) para compartir con tus padres, es importante que busques la ayuda de algún consejero profesional, terapista o sicólogo.  La Terapia Cognitiva Conductual enfocada en el Trauma, es una técnica que te ayudara a manejar muchos de los síntomas, también puedes utilizar diarios o Terapia Narrativa o creativa, para expresar memorias y procesarlas luego en terapia.  Un Psiquiatra también te puede proveer medicamentos que ayudan a manejar los síntomas del Estrés Post Traumático, pero es importante que atiendas el problema inicial para poder sanar por completo y volver a tomar las riendas de tu vida.   Muchas organizaciones como los Fondos Unidos (211 en muchos estados) tiene recursos que proveen referidos a consejeros o profesionales de la salud mental.  También puedes preguntarle a tu consejero escolar, doctor o en la iglesia.

There's a modern parable about two young brothers. One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable; the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy. So then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. He says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says ""With all this sht, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!""Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say ""I always see the worst end of things"". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change. The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women. The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how; but you lack energy right now.

1. Your boyfriend is probably not leaving you. This is a common false positive. I've seen the test too. It seems like something is wrong when your boyfriend starts acting distant. Sometimes your behaviour or moods can be the cause of this. Try being less sensitive or make small changes to change his behaviour (for example eat dinner at a different place or going to a friend's house). Please remember that reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness. Telling people you're struggling is one of the most important ways to improve yourself.
2. You're probably not failing your driving test. This sounds like you are getting better, but the number of wrong answers is too high, which is a common error in interpretation. A good way to improve is to start small, like practicing driving in the neighborhood without a passenger.
3. I'm not sure what you mean by ""I see my future crumble"". Are you experiencing things that are happening in the future? Or are you experiencing things that are happening in your past? A common cause of false positives for nostalgia is the passage of time. Sometimes old items"

I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.",https://counselchat.com/questions/how-can-i-love-myself,depression,"Lynda MartensMarriage & Family Therapist, MSc, RP, RMFT",https://counselchat.com/therapists/ms-lynda-martens-london-ontario,"I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self?

It sounds like you need therapy. Middle school is a challenging time for many reasons and one of them is losing a loved one, like your grandma.

There are many good reasons why you didn't say no. You didn't say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared; there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary.

What are you avoiding feeling? Unloved, unwanted, cold? What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no? That you didn't have to do anything you don't want to do? That you're special, or that sexuality is special? Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is?

I think this is a solid path to take.

The next time you feel tempted to agree to something you don't want to do, you can remind yourself that you're in control. You can be present in the situation. And even if the situation feels threatening or uncomfortable, it doesn't mean it's not best for you to keep your distance.

Most therapists are very good at spotting the signs and treating accordingly, although only a physician can prescribe medication.The great news is that depression is treatable. Some people experiencing depression may benefit from medication (often to lift the heaviness of the illness enough so that one can focus on psychotherapy), and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural activation therapy have demonstrated a clear ability to reduce symptoms of depression. Even if medication helps, seeing a therapist to look at the roots of your depression and to build coping skills is very important.

The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or ""If I move forward, that will mean...""  Keep going...what would be the worst part of that?  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in ""If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable"", or ""No one will ever love me as much as she did"". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!",2,90,train,"I hate to hear this, but I've felt this way too. It's so hard to find someone who you feel completely connected to. But, I recommend writing her a letter. Just a simple letter telling her how much you miss her and how much you want to be with her again. Give specific examples of what she does that makes you feel close to her. Also, think about going to her school and handing out her letters in the halls. Ask her friends to help spread the word. This is a great way to get everyone excited and bring you both back into her life. Good luck!"

When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about?

School can be a very stressful place. You are likely experiencing a lot of social anxiety, which can impact your sleeping, eating, sleeping, sleeping patterns. Please do look into hypnotherapy to help you relax, or even talk to your therapist about taking an anti-depressant. 

Social anxiety can also impact your “friend ship”. It’s also possible that some of your friends are avoiding you because you seem withdrawn or acting out. You may want to try and reach out again, either by text, asking to meet up, or even just being friendlier.

It is common to feel alone in the process of dying. What others may find comforting is that dying does not have to be a lonely experience.

For instance, you can attend memorials for people you care about, like a funeral or a memorial service. These can be therapeutic for both the mourner and the mourner's guests. You can engage in care giving or service to those who may be grieving, which can help relieve stress. It is also common for many people to find comfort in having pets near them during the dying process. Many hospice programs provide palliative care dogs and cats that can provide soothing companionship and joy.

I would highly recommend speaking with your fiancée about what you are feeling and if a service dog could help. It may be a good idea to start small and see if your fiancée is open to trying a low impact service dog that doesn't require medication. A service dog could help her be more assertive in public places and be less self-conscious.  A service dog could also help your fiancée feel more supported by alerting her to when there is something around that could harm her. It could be something as simple as a ringing cellphone or a loud noise. While it is important to keep an open mind to explore all options, it could also be a good idea to consult with a professional who may be able to offer a more informed opinion.  It may be worth investigating whether the cost of a service dog is worth it for your fiancée to be able to live a more healthier lifestyle."

Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare I can’t get to the bottom of. I’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems?

This is a new term for me... ""semirelationship"". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a ""hookup"" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hookups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup. Research tells us that, after a hookup, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you! Good!

Losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place. Anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately. A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task, it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future.

For one, you could be grieving the end of a long term relationship that was hard to get out of and the end of a love triangle. Another possibility is that you might be feeling guilty about the breakup given how quickly you fell for the guy. However, the most likely explanation is that you feel very attached to the ex and are grieving the loss of his/her affection. Regardless of the reason, whether it's the fault of the ex or not, it hurts when you feel that attachment lacking. I would recommend finding a therapist who specializes in attachment issues and/or therapy with a licensed counselor."

The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve.

The problem with not being in a relationship is that you let yourself get into a negative cycle which goes something like this. You spend time daydreaming about them, to where you start making assumptions about them and start finding fault in them. It gets to the point where you stop seeing them as a person and start seeing them as a flaw. You don't want to let them out of your sight, so you start waiting around for them to become romantically interested in you. Unfortunately the truth is most people are just very busy and their brain is just not geared towards forming long term relationships so the interest wanes over time. So you become impatient and the conversations you have where you get the most negative vibes from them is when they're waiting for the phone to ring or are on their laptop or when they have their back turned towards you.

This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You can do it!",2,272,train,"While social isolation is hard to break I think that it's important to note that it is not depression or even anxiety that is keeping someone from making friends.  It is that they are choosing not to make friends.  Anxiety and depression have all manner of symptoms.  Many of those symptoms are exactly the type of thing that would make it hard for someone to make friends like being quiet or socially awkward.  And many times those symptoms may be worse during social times, so when someone with depression or anxiety sits down to eat a meal or go to a party those social things are not going to happen.  This can lead to some level of social isolation which is something the friendrual kind of looks out for you from avoiding situations that could be difficult to them.  But social things are not always going to happen and for those people it is important to befriend them, and ask them to join things you are interested in."

Thank you reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help. I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can. First and foremost, you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man. I’m going to assume there are. So, the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself, if you and your children are safe? Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming and going or currently living in the home, my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe (i.e. family members home, friend or a shelter temporarily). I cannot stress this enough. Although, some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they are drinking, they only do it when they are mad), it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So, you can never take abuse (physical or mental) lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children.It’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy; however, that is no longer your concern.

I also imagine that being cheated on hurts your sense of trust in your spouse and I imagine that would be very distressing and maybe even trigger your fear of being betrayed again. If you still feel safe, here are some steps that you can take.
First, try to understand what happened. Was he trying to be faithful, but life got in the way? Was he self-centered? Was he struggling with mental health? It would be good to understand his side of things. 
Second, try to be mindful of your own emotional needs. Being married with two kids for 3 years and still being worried about how your spouse is doing feels to me like it is an important emotional need. You need to make sure you take care of yourself. Try to eat well, spend time with friends and family, and take some time for yourself.

Humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others, but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us. It is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past, maybe your family, or other traumatic interactions with others.

Of course you prefer animals (me too!), they provide unconditional love and support, do not judge you, and do not require you to have conversations with them. The fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people, you are craving some social connection. What is probably the case is that you were never really taught how to interact and have those conversations.

I think it's possible that you prefer animals (or other humans) over people. This is hard to understand since humans are very social animals that are perfectly fine when around other humans.

There is another possibility. It could be your genes. You may have a variation in a certain gene that triggers anxiety or an excitement to interact with people (or animals). It could be harder to understand this as an genetic explanation because we don't know if your parents or even grandparents had this type of gene. We could only guess based on our own genetic history.

Good news  you're not alone in this experience! That being said, it can be so frustrating and upsetting to have to contend with the anxious thoughts that come up in our heads, sometimes without any warning. Additionally, nighttime is a particularly vulnerable time for a lot of people wherein anxiety rears its' ugly head even more so. We aren't as distracted at night and our resources are more depleted so we can't fight back against these thoughts as effectively as usual. It can be helpful to externalize our anxiety, give it a name, like ""Judy"" or ""Bill"" for example (or perhaps something more sinister like Lord Garmadon??). The naming is all up to you, what comes to mind for you when you think of your anxiety, now what is a name that's fitting? The act of externalizing separates us from the anxiety a bit and makes it a little more tolerable. If you can think of your anxiety as just something else to handle rather than it being a part of your personality, this is usually helpful. Additionally, I recommend not avoiding the situations that make you feel this way. Our brains have to learn what is an actual threat and what is not.

Write down the thoughts that are leading to you feeling terrible and crying.  Maybe that's:  I'm stupid, Everyone else is having a good time so I should be too, There's something wrong with me.  Just writing these down is an important starting point because it allows you to be objective to your thoughts.  When you see them on paper, you can start to identify the lies and reframe them.  Next to your negative thoughts, write some positives:  I have something to offer, I'm okay the way I am, It's okay to prefer 1:1 relationships, etc.  Hopefully even as you read some of those suggestions, you feel a little lighter and more okay with yourself.

Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true.

Through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. I'll get you started and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.It's natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. Our brains are complex, wonderful things. Fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture; their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it. But what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily. We often spend TOO MUCH time worrying about things that happened or might happen. When these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life, it becomes a problem. So, while fear and anxiety try to protect us, they also seek power and will take any power they can get.In general, fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things: that something is wrong with us, or that something bad will happen (or that something bad will happen because there's something wrong with us). They will use anything they can as evidence to convince you. For example... ""That person looked at you funny. You're strange looking"". Well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person's face, and it's unlikely it had anything to do with you. For you personally, your thoughts are about the afterlife...about living forever. What does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? What would the worst part be? A therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. It might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go. It might be that you fear going to hell because you're ""bad"". Search for that deepest fear.I invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. It's a heavy glass, and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it, it would get in the way; you'd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. That's what's happening now. I suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you're having; we all have random silly thoughts that usually aren't true. The problem is how long you're holding it in your hand. You could have that thought (pick up that glass) a hundred times a day and, as long as you put it right back on the shelf, it's not a problem. The trick is to get it back on that shelf.Right now, you're using distraction to do this. You're trying to focus on other things around you, but I think the glass is still in your hand. It's not enough; you're looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf.  And the key is in your thoughts. Once you find out what fear is trying to tell you, then you can ""talk back to"" fear. So, as an example, if fear is saying to you ""you have no control over anything"", then you can work to accept the pieces you don't have control over, learn to tolerate that feeling, and claim back the pieces you CAN control. You CAN control the extent to which you let fear take you over. With a therapist you can learn to ""refute"" fears' ideas. You can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear's lies and gain back control over your thoughts. I wish you the best!",2,416,train,"You are not crazy, it is natural to feel the way you feel but the idea of life after death is not an unnatural thought. There are many cultures around the world that believe in life after death. Science has not been able to prove life after death does not exist, but the lack of evidence for life after death is compelling. What is compelling to one person may not be compelling to another. As you are a unique person there are things that are compelling to you that are not compelling to other people, that is all."

That is, when I asked hard questions about this subject, things that I had believed became less and less likely.  For example, I had believed that if someone died suddenly from an injury that could not be treated, they went to hell and would continue to suffer there until the time limit ran out.  But once I started questioning the subject, this belief became less and less likely and I was able to determine exactly when my time limit had run out.  At that point, I went to a local bookstore and bought a book by someone who had done the research on this subject, and the author proved that the person who died had in fact been in heaven.  And at that point, I had to decide whether or not I believed in heaven, and I decided that I didn't.

What I want to focus on is the fear & anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions. Scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they're out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but I want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic & anxiety. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories,  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought. I would also suggest when you're having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how you're breathing. Often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full, deep breath or what is called belly breathing. If you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths, bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale, just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins.",0,196,train,It sounds like you're thinking about the afterlife in a way that doesn't feel natural to you. Perhaps you should talk with a mental health professional about these thoughts so that they don't feel overwhelming or anxiety-inducing.

Obviously, I can't diagnose you from one paragraph, so it would be wise to visit an experienced mental health professional (either a counselor or an MD in your area) to help you with disengaging from your selfdestructive thoughts.

I am sorry that you are feeling overwhelmed and anxious and I am here to listen and help. I want you to know that it is totally normal to experience anxiety when thinking about the afterlife.

That is, while there is good evidence that our minds give rise to new experiences and this new experience, or out-of-this-world experience, is what we call life after life, we have no empirical evidence that an afterlife exists. An afterlife is just a comforting thought that gives meaning to life, but we have no empirical evidence for or against this idea. So while you may be feeling anxious when you think about the afterlife, it is totally normal and expected.

I don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.There is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performancerelated) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.If this feels pretty structured, it is initially. Generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.If the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own, consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.",0,60,train,"I feel safe and secure when I am in a relationship.

Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds, and then out for 78 seconds. Try to repeat this for 35 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.",1,231,train,"I would suggest seeking professional help to help manage your anxieties.

Often, cognitive distortions are the problem. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mindreading (I just know he is angry at me) and can'tstanditis (I can't stand this situation). There are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local CBT therapist. Another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called ""symptom stress""  being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, ""Oh no I'm getting nervous about this, I'm getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack!"" followed by  more cognitive distortions such as ""I can't stand being anxious!"" and ""this is horrible!"" The antidote to this is acceptance.  Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon KabatZinn). If you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself  this is just a reaction I'm having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. I can tolerate and survive some anxiety, I can breathe deeply, and I'll be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.We can increase our awareness of anxietyprovoking selftalk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring selftalk. We have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to selfperception theory, "" we learn what we believe when we hear ourselves speak,"" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)",0,172,train,"It is helpful to write things down. A daily journal can help you to evaluate the importance of the stressors, and provide a place to place your mind on hold when needed.

One approach to this is to try and think of evidence or data to support the idea that you are a fraud.

This is because the human brain does not ""know"" how to think in terms of what is real vs. what is not real.

Find a rationalization: Take some time to think of a good rationalization for why you believe you are a good student. Examples include ""Most professors like me"", ""I cite many publications"", or ""My GRE scores were high"". These rationalizations will help your brain shift the beliefs that you are a good student to other thoughts in the short term.
Examine your evidence: Examine your beliefs about your academic competence objectively. For example, examine your accomplishments as a student, or look at other students' evaluations of you. Don't just look at your transcript. Think about other aspects of your character that would correlate with your high GRE scores.

That success is remarked upon, and  until someone does the event better than they did  they are 'the best.' Grad school, however, is not so great at discrete goals and celebrations of success. You got a good grade on an assignment, but what about the next one? You and 6 other people in your class probably got the same grade, so does that make you a success or average? It falls to you, then, to identify ways you are sure you've succeeded. If your grades and peer admiration aren't hallmarks of success enough, perhaps pull your measuring tool inward: measure your achievements against your own progress ie: I got a 93 on my last assignment, I got a 97 this time!

First, I am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional, your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 510 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we  are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. Wishing you the very best!Laura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC",1,375,train,"Yes. I have anxiety, too.  While we don't know exactly why you have anxiety, I do know that therapy can help.  Anxiety can cause many physical symptoms that may be difficult for you to identify, which is why it's important to talk about what you're experiencing with your therapist.  The more you talk about your symptoms with your therapist, the more familiar you will become with this and the better you will be at identifying it when it happens.  Anxiety can also cause emotional symptoms such as stress, fear and sadness.  Talking about those symptoms with your therapist can help you become familiar with them and more comfortable when they occur."

Some helpful ways to get yourself ready to go to therapy include:
1. Write down a list of all the reasons you want to go to therapy. List anything that is helpful or comes to mind. Examples of things to bring to therapy include glasses, socks, deodorant, lotion etc.
2. Try to schedule at least two or three hours of time for therapy. 
3. Go to your local library or book store and get a book that you are interested in, for example ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg.

I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way. First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her. Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share. And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult. Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.",1,413,train,"There are many factors that contribute to nervousness or anxiety.  From your anxiety symptoms going away after a session to your therapist not offering you a refund for not feeling any improvement after a few sessions.  Your first step is to check in with yourself.

Ask yourself ""how"" can I heal my anxiety and truly have a experience that helps me heal?

Some of the important concepts to understand when engaging with therapy, whether through in-person or digital, are:

Anxiety can be triggered by many things (e.g. public speaking, standing in a line), and so the approach to ""entering"" a session, which is often timed, can be challenging for many people with anxiety. It is helpful to note that triggering information - such as what exactly happened the last time you had a panic attack or the last time you saw someone that triggers you - and anxiety triggers are very helpful in helping a therapist narrow in on a more targeted intervention.

Anxiety is very individualized. What may work for one person with anxiety may not work for another. Some people find that setting pre-determined goals (e.g. getting to the car on time) helps manage anxiety.

In my experience, the majority of people who go to therapy for the first time eventually feel more comfortable going to therapy sessions, even if they initially struggled with anxiety or a feeling of fear when entering the room. The reason is that your brain is actually trying to protect you from the unknown. Like a small child who's being given the ""ultimate scare"" for the first time, your brain is trying to protect you by warning you that this unknown thing might actually hurt you. It's your natural, normal reaction, and it should be familiar. That being said, there are things you can do to gradually train your mind to not be surprised and become more comfortable when you go to therapy. 

One way is by creating a small story in your mind about what you're most worried about happening, and then as you enter the room gradually add elements to that story until you are surprised and your nervousness decreases.

- Visualization is also very helpful for anxiety reduction. You can practice this by envisioning the space you're going into filled with light, bliss, or whatever it is that helps relax you. Think about creating that space in your mind and breathing into it.
- Grab a warm blanket, curl up with a good book, or take a bath. You can even do this while you exercise or while you take a break from exercise.
- If it's at all possible, find a different type of therapy. It might be that you just need to find a therapist that one doesn't mind being uncomfortable with. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapists out there that are known for their ability to reduce anxiety, so try to find someone that you feel comfortable with."

I would recommend seeking outside help from a therapist who specializes in couples therapy. Also, asking him to regularly check in with you through text messages or phone calls during his travels can help keep you both up to date on what is going on. Ask him to schedule a 1-on-1 session to ask him questions you have about his job or travel. This can help get you both into a mindset where you can continue to communicate with each other while he is away and remind him of your significance in his life."

It's normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection. So, just because your boyfriend isn't talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesn't necessarily mean what you fear it means...that he's forgotten about you or loves you less. It could mean quite the opposite...that he's focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you. He may think he's loving you more, but you feel loved less. You have two jobs to do here. The first is to manage your anxiety by ""talking back"" to the thoughts it puts into your head. It sounds like ""It's normal to be insecure, but I have tons of evidence that he loves me and that I mean the world to him..."" Find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim. The second part of your job is to let him know what you need. You need more affection and connection during this period when he's away (more texts, phone calls, information). It's okay to want that, and I am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when he's away.",1,608,train,"Thank you for your inquiry.  I would recommend reaching out to a psychologist or therapist for guidance.  My suggestion would be to try to develop some kind of buddy system with a friend.  Your friend can contact your boyfriend via text, Facebook messenger, phone call or any other method of communication to let your boyfriend know you are worried and miss him.  If your boyfriend does not contact you and sends a text to your friend instead, that is another opportunity to call your boyfriend and/or try to contact him when he is away.  It is very important that your boyfriend knows that you want him to communicate with you as much as possible.  This may help reduce some of his anxiety and help you feel less anxious and alone.  At the same time, your boyfriend should know that not being able to communicate with him does not mean that you want to break up with him.  Communication and feeling connected are very important parts of healthy and happy relationships."

Would you be able to tell him that you need more connection from him, like you used to during the early days of dating? Or, perhaps you could ask him to list ways that he could increase his connection with you. It can be hard for people to read minds, so you could try to write down some general guidelines/suggestions and share them with him.

Being nervous is not just normal, it may actually help you be on your toes and do a good job.  Unless YOU think you have anxiety, do not let others predict your future.If you believe you are anxious, get in to see a therapist and address it.  Anxiety is very treatable, and you don't have to suffer with it  but you do have to acknowledge it and work towards health.However....If, in  your experience, this is more a nervous energy than an anxiety issue, there are things you can do to address it:  Make sure you take good care of yourself, especially in the first month or two of the new job.

Your brain, that magnificent machine, is notmuch different than the brain that kept your ancestors alive in dangeroussituations.  Today, though you may notneed to worry about a mountain lion having you for dinner, other stresses areperceived and processed just you’re the physical dangers your ancestors faced.That means a looming deadline or a fight withyour partner creates the same ""fight/flight/freeze"" response thatsaved your ancestor way back in the day. If you ""burned off"" that adrenaline and cortisol cocktail byrunning or fighting off a predator, you would feel the relief and exhaustionbut you would have also metabolized the stress chemicals that are meant to keepyou alive. However, when there is no physical response tothe stressor your body is ""all wound up with no place to go"".  Over time this creates not only the""bouncy brain"" feeling of distractibility and distress, but canmanifest itself in physical ailments.It’s impossible to avoid stress forever, butsometimes you just need a way to relieve the pressures of life for a moment.Here's a quick way to settle your brain into a feeling of rest instead ofdistress:Put one hand on your chest at collarbone leveland one on your belly just under your naval. Now, take a slow deep breath filling your abdomen with air, just likeyou would fill a glass with water...from the bottom up.  When you are full of air, pause for just amoment and really feel the fullness. Then slowly exhale, just like you would pour water out, from the topdown.

If you are simply nervous or feel anxious in general (which is not caused by a real physiological anxiety attack) there are a couple of things you can try. One is distraction. Find a book or a quiet activity to take your mind off of the trip. If that does not work find something to do that requires low intensity focus, like playing a board game or taking a bath. You can also try a beta blockers, which are drugs your doctor can prescribe to help reduce anxiety. I would recommend avoiding sedatives as they can be risky if overdosed on and may have negative side effects.

Transitions can be challenging, and it sounds like you are experiencing a lot of change.  This would be difficult for many people, and it seems that you have an added layer of challenge.  I recommend visiting a therapist to determine the root cause of your anxiety and working to unravel those causes piece by piece. I know seeing a therapist can be challenging when traveling, and online counseling could be a good solution. In the meantime, here are a few of my favorite anxiety stopping strategies.  1. Grounding Exercises: When you feel your anxiety increasing, take a deep breath and begin things in your room (or where ever you are) that have things in common. For example, name all of the blue things that you can see.  You can also do nonvisual grounding exercises like naming all of the hte sports teams you can think of or all of the state capitals.  This will get your mind off of your anxiety and connect you to space.  2. The pretzel: This is a seated pose that will stop any anxiety attack in its tracks.  Start in a seated position and cross your dominate leg over your nondominant leg. Then, stretch your arms out in front of you with the back of your hands facing one another.  Cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching.  Flip your arms into your body.  You will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin.  Close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.  This calming pose will help you get through even the toughest of panic episodes. 3. Bilateral stimulation and visualization: Start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. Tap each knee in an alternating pattern. Close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. The combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind.  I could go on and on, but these techniques should get you started.  These techniques should help you manage anxiety in a pinch.  Best of luck!",0,139,train,"This is certainly a cause for concern. I would like to spend some time understanding a bit more about your triggers and learn some techniques to manage them. One way to begin is to take a look at your health insurance coverage. It may be able to provide you with a list of therapists that you can visit for advice or assistance during this process. If you have a dog, you may want to consider getting one of those dog Assistance Certificates so that if you need help walking the dog while you are away from home, you will have assistance. I also recommend reading up on some of the techniques that have worked well for others in similar situations.

You're not alone in feeling nervous or even experiencing anxiety. It's actually very common. It's important that you seek out professional guidance, as well as individual guidance from people close to you. Seek out understanding and safety in a community of kindred spirits. You can order yourself a glass of wine or another alcohol free beverage and just tell someone you trust what you're feeling. Many people find that they can engage in a type of meditation called ""deep breathing"". Focus on your stomach expanding as you breathe in and let your stomach and belly breathe out as you breathe out. Repeat this phrase ""I am safe, I am safe, I am safe"". This can help to calm you and reaffirm that you are safe and loved. Another effective way to combat anxiety is visualization. Many people are naturally auditory per sons, so you could perform a mental rehearsal of the steps to take while anxiety strikes. Picture the situation in your head - visualize your feet walking toward your car, turn the engine on, buckle your seat belt, start the car, drive to work, take a deep breath, get to work, take some more deep"

Notice if your anxiety feels like excitement, concerns, or fear.It seems like you are excited about your new job, but worried because OTHERS are telling you that you have anxiety.   Let's notice how other‘s input is affecting your thoughts and maybe causing more anxiety that you may really have.   If you are indeed experiencing anxiety, that does not mean that you will have panic attacks.   But if you are experiencing panic attacks, or suffer them at some point, you could learn how to reduce them either with therapy or medication.You can learn how to process it depending what triggers it and channel it, in a useful way.  For example, you could plan a schedule around your new job and be meticulous about it because you are worried about how your new job may affect your routine, or, you could feel overwhelmed with your schedule, focus on the feeling, but not do anything about it.  Notice the difference?  The key is in recognizing if you are anxious about something that you can change or have control over it, and take action if you do, and recognizing when you cannot control things and be OK with not being in control.I teach clients how to use meditation and cognitive reframing techniques to help calm anxiety symptoms.

Commuting long distances can be stressful, but there are some things you can do.First, make sure that your seating arrangement in your car is comfortable. If you are driving long distances on a regular basis, you want to make sure that your body is in a comfortable position. Second, select some music or podcasts that work for you, rather than against you. Soothing music is good, as well as inspirational podcasts.

If the drive normally takes you 30 minutes, plan on 45 (or if it's 45 minutes, plan on an hour).

I can relate to what other people have told you - it feels like the advice you're getting is coming from an ""anxiety-medicalized"" world, which can be isolating and not helpful.

It is so important to remember that traveling is a really healthy and natural thing to do in our society, and it doesn't necessarily mean anxiety.

For one, your life is more complicated and likely to include long commutes than you're used to, and that can lead to stress and nervousness. For another, new cities and places could make you feel nervous - even if you've been to this place before. You could be in a new city and still feel nervous! Even if you know it's a beautiful place to be, you can get overwhelmed by all the new things you see and new things you're curious about. New experiences give you a ton of opportunities to grow, and feeling nervous about something could actually prevent you from having an enjoyable experience! It's okay to feel nervous about something, as long as it doesn't have a snowball effect.

Sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself.  So, when we begin to move on and see other people, our sense of identity may be obscured.  The tendency is to seek out validation to give us a feeling of worthiness.   That it's ok to move on and be happy.   This is a relatively normal reaction.  It's important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion through this time in your life.  Mindful selfcompassion can be a great way to begin the process of getting that sense of who you are back and what you want in a relationship.  I think its important to look back, learn what you can from the previous relationship, and become a better person for it in the future.  At the same time, taking the necessary time to nuture yourself on a mind, body, and spirit level. Selfcompassion allows you to turn inward and except all facets of who you are.

Secondly, try and make sure you don't do anything drastic, I know it feels like you will run out of time, but try to take things one step at a time and don't be afraid to sit and think about your situation. Writing things down helps me a lot, I will often write out lists of things I need to do to help ease my transition.

I suggest you keep that perception in the present and do not seek that validation now from other sources. You want to be content in the present, but also wise about how you react to outside influences or dopamine hits.
As you age you find you don't need that same validation from someone outside of yourself. You will develop friendships and relationships that provide that validation, just as you grew up learning from your parents or in school from your teachers.
With a new relationship, you will feel lost for awhile because your emotional needs are not met from a relationship. In order to feel that you need to seek that validation from others as well. If the relationship ends that validation will not be there. It is better if you seek it out from outside sources because there are those that the relationship might create. They might tell you that you are a good friend or they might give you material things that you seek that validation from. This can lead to more excitement and therefore more dopamine hits.

I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone  (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well.

No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it.

It can be challenging to go outside and live your life, but it's even more challenging when you're struggling to keep track of all of your daily responsibilities. It's helpful to talk to someone about your concerns, and it's important to be open to the idea that things might not be completely “cured” right away.

The presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it!   What language can you change in your self talk?  For example, are you saying ""I can't speak in front of an audience! I'll fail?""  That sounds a lot different than ""I studied my butt off and if I practice speaking out loud, I can ace this presentation!""  Although this is a short answer, I do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence.",1,213,train,"First, identify what exactly makes you feel stressed out when you present. Being shy can make it hard for you to engage with people, so perhaps the biggest issue is that you're feeling intimidated by the audience or that you're worrying about looking stupid. Tailoring your speech to the audience--which you have control over--can help alleviate some of that stress. For example, if you are presenting to a large auditorium, you may want to consider speaking in a more conversational tone, and include facts or other examples from your research that are likely to be relevant to the audience.

Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend.

1. Get external support: Find a friend or mentor who can provide a safe space to express your thoughts and feelings. Having someone who is also very shy to practice with can help you overcome your anxiety.
2. Practice. Choose a topic that you are interested in and learn everything you can about it. Practice presenting on that topic and find a way to present awkwardly so that you can actually feel your feelings. 
3. Focus on the goal. Rather than focusing on the presentation as the end all be all, think about how you can structure the presentation so that you get a sense of achievement at the end. For example, if you have a bio exam, instead of only focusing on the paper, think about how you can study for the exam, and focus on the steps towards getting the assignment completed."

Therapy can be a scary experience and hearing your own thoughts and describing your emotions can be a difficult thing to do. It's perfectly normal to be worried before your first counseling appointment and to feel a fair amount of nervousness when the time comes to talk about your feelings and emotions.
Part of counseling is addressing the uncertainty that many of us feel about our emotions and thoughts, so it's natural to be a little hesitant or fearful to first time counseling patients. However, there are steps you can take to help prepare for your appointment:

- Write down questions you want to ask your therapist. A good therapist will be able to anticipate your questions, so ask your questions beforehand so you don't feel rushed during your appointment.
- Research the topic of your therapy. Make sure you are well-informed about the material. For example, if your therapist is going to be discussing a difficult topic such as a childhood trauma, do some research on the topic before your appointment to learn more. 
- Give yourself enough time to get ready for your appointment. Try to wait at least an hour before beginning any self care activities (e.t.xng, coffee, therapy, etc.) so you have time to spend getting ready"

Sometimes, though, there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear. If you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor, you might just cry in spite of your fears about it. Your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality, so even though it's embarrassing, finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it.

I think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing, laughing, coughing. You can't help but do those things and most people won't really judge negatively if you do it in public. Similarly, crying is our body's reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy, from a hilarious joke or from being upset.

As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another.  Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe ,  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before.  I have seen  people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard.   I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving.   I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry  and there is nothing to be embarrassed about.   Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down.   Crying is  often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .So , to summarize , don't worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable  at first , but I promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy.

Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful.

It's important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body & mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us, which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals, like adrenaline or cortisol.  So, one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety, such as fear, stress. negative thought patterns, not enough food or sleep. Keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills & techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep. One quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes, sometimes this is called belly breathing. When you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates. Many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath, and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress & anxiety .",0,92,val,"What I found really interesting is that, my friend, all the people who were in the store that day didn't even notice that I was late, and I felt really embarrassed.

First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue. Everyone, at some point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment. But for many people, this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life.  They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is  great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is  a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others. The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever ""get over"", but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently. A colleague may offer some other advice, as well.. Be wellRobin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",1,288,train,"Avoiding large groups of people may not be a healthy approach to reducing fear of embarrassment.

I understand your concern. Being in a loving relationship with someone who has a long term partner can be wonderful and fulfilling. Being in a relationship with someone you have been with for three years, who has three years of memories and adventures that you get to experience together is very special.

Worrying that your partner is not in a relationship with someone new and exciting can make you feel quite anxious. We often think that if our partner were having an affair, we would know because we would feel so much anxiety. But your partner may simply be living their life and experiencing the relationship that you are a part of, just the way you are experiencing it. This can be challenging to understand.

I can understand that your anxiety makes it hard for you to be in a relationship with your partner. This might be because your anxiety has conditioned you to interpret all of his behavior as an affair. Being in a loving relationship is hard work, and your partner may not know how to be with you. As you build trust with your partner, your anxiety can also decrease.

One way to manage your anxiety is to recognize that you may worry too much, and this can lead to you not fully enjoying your relationship."

Clearly this is something that has you very concerned. Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless. Many people have thoughts of killing someone, but they would never actually do it. They really don't even want to do it, they are just having a thought. Other times, thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should receive help when they start to worry us. I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement. Now, If you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality you should call for help immediately. By help, I mean 911, or a family member or friend. You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. Again, none of this is to judge, but rather to encourage you to get the help you're seeking. Either way, when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior, seeking counseling is usually a good choice. Be well, Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC",0,81,train,"The simple answer is that we are born with an evolutionarily created ""fight or flight"" mechanism. When people are threatened, their brains activate a flight response, causing many of the same physiological responses that cause in animals when they are threatened or attacked. During this response, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis releases hormones such as adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, and cortisol which affect many bodily functions. Adrenaline causes constricted pupils and raised heart rate, nor-adrenaline affects the smooth muscles of the arteries and raises blood pressure, and cortisol lowers both. This mechanism has evolved to ensure that when we are threatened or attacked, our body prepares us to flee to safety, and these same physiological mechanisms are also triggered when we are crying in sadness or fear. One of the clearest examples of this is the ""fight or flight"" reaction that one sees in animals when they are threatened. When a person is threatened, their face may turn bright red or their pupils may become dilated; this is exactly the same physiological response that one sees in animals when they are threatened. I can think of no other evolutionary reason for this reaction, unless these thoughts lead to the actual act of killing someone."

One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life.   When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention, then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them.  This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed in.A simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactions.To know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life!",0,425,val,"Everyone has experienced a panic attack at some point.

Many people think that a panic attack happens suddenly, but in reality, a person may spend hours or days wondering what may trigger a panic attack. An effective way to reduce the chance of experiencing a panic attack is to train yourself to recognize and avoid situations that cause anxiety. This can be done through activities such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on the thoughts and emotions that are the root cause of an anxiety disorder. This therapy approach often involves practicing skills to help manage anxiety and uncertainty, as these are likely the situations that cause a panic attack. Another effective treatment option includes medication, such as beta blockers, which can be used to reduce the physiological effects of a panic attack."

If you shake all the time, consider talking with your primary care physician. Sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance (such as thyroid).One of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety (particularly panic attacks) can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks. Also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brain's protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat. You may have heard of the fight or flight response. When you have an anxiety attack, your body is preparing you to react to something that isn't actually a threat, so it's almost as if you're fight or flight response is overactive. Here is an image that may be helpful: http://psychology.tools/fightorflightresponse.htmlThere are many different things you can do. You can practice breathing, mindfulness, meditation, or yoga techniques. If you decide to try some breathing techniques, try breathing in for a count of five, holding for a count of five, breathing out for a count of five, and repeating five times.Also remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when you're not having a panic attack. At that point, it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic. Also remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes.

To combat burnout, it is important to first understand what exactly burnout is. Burnout occurs when you experience too much stress or pressure and the amount of that stress or pressure is exceeds your personal coping mechanisms (such as your energy reserves, resilience, or willingness to engage with people). As a result of experiencing too much stress or pressure, your physical and mental health takes a hit.

In fact, our five main emotions are joy, fear, sadness, shame, and anger.

What behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you? What skills, knowledge, or personal qualities would you develop?

I challenge you to do the following exercise:What is a goal you would like to achieve? Example: I would like to change careersWhat actions are necessary to complete this goal? Example: see a career counselor to determine my ideal career, go back to school/get a certification, network with others in my desired industryWhat thoughts, feelings, or urges might get in my way? Example: thoughts of ""What if I fail? I'm not smart enough. I can't do it. I'm too busy to put energy into this."" Feelings of fear, shame, excitement. Urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking action.It would be helpful to remind myself that: example: It is natural to have these thoughts, feelings, and urges but I can take action anyway.

Fear is not always a bad thing, and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation. A phobia, however, is different. You used the term ""fear"" rather than ""phobia"". A phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. If your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.Everyone has fears, or things that make them nervous. Public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. When you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. A lot of times, it is a selfesteem issue. You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue. Some fears are caused by trauma. Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into ""fight or flight"" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. In cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, I strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims.",0,200,train,"If you want to face your fear, try this: start with something small that you can do right now.

I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you. In other words, does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it. Yes, this could well be an expression of anxiety, or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific (or perhaps even nonspecific) circumstances. Do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior? Do you feel good after you have done it? The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage, so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor, to rule out any injury. If none exists, this obviously doesn't excuse the behavior, it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.When we do any behavior of any kind, it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem, or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue, when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there, but now they are intoxicated. No closer to solving the issue. When we deal with things like anxiety or depression, we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms, but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm, but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.Sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm, wouldn't you agree? So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings, as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.Reach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you.",0,79,train,"Since you have hit your head on the floor and walls for so long without realizing it, it is probably because you are still practicing your injojet.

One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe.  The more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking, isolated physical surroundings, and being in isolated locations with someone with whom you're not very familiar, probably your fear will decrease.The other general direction to understand is if in your family history, people have been violated severely, either emotionally, mentally, or physically.In families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves, often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others, plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generation.Its possible then, that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own suffering.The good news is that individual therapy, with a credentialed and licensed therapist, is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden.",2,209,train,"You may be afraid of sharks because of past experiences or simply due to the media.

You may be right, your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety. That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances. Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock. That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress. If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms, you may want to visit your primary care provider. They may tell you that they don't see anything physically wrong with you, and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience. A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way. I work as a counselor in primary care, and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse. Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common. Sometimes, with counseling, those physical symptoms actually stop. Be well, and I hope you feel better soon.Robin J.

If the Xanax is not working well for you, I wonder if something else may work better. What is your reasoning there?

While counselors work closely with medical providers, and sometimes have discussions about medications with people, we rarely make recommendations about how much or what type of medication a person should be taking. This is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice. The only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, etc. Having said that, I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with. If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks, you should consider it. Medications can be helpful for anxiety, and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief, but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety longterm. Therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with. Exposure therapy has good outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks. If you are interested in speaking with your provider about the Xanax, I think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine. The provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication. Please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time. Medications like Xanax really are highly addictive. The more you take, the more you may feel you need. The more often you may feel you need to use it. Depending on the frequency and amount of use, some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication. It is a good idea to talk to medical provider about all of those things so that you can partner on right course of action to manage this anxiety. I certainly hope that you get some relief....

However, you have been clear that you are not happy with the frequency or quality of your sex lives so that sounds like a good place to start. I would also encourage you to talk to a therapist about whether it is healthy for you to have sex again - they can prescribe different ways to stimulate your body and explore your desires while also keeping you safe."

Sex is one of the most beautiful things in the world and being able to bring two people together and create life is a beautiful thing. That being said, it is also incredibly dangerous. It can cause harm to both people involved.

Even if you have both forms of protection on (i.e. a condom and a personal injury shield), there is still the chance of a negative reaction to either the intercourse or the sensation during intercourse. It is important to discuss this with your partner so that they are aware of what the potential risks are should something go wrong and are prepared if that happens. There are plenty of resources online about these issues, so please consult those if you need more information.

The thing that I think is most hurtful is not being able to enjoy sex as much. Sex is meant to be a high for many people, and when you are so concerned with the potential risks, you are essentially treating it as something that can harm you, instead of simply treating it as a joyful activity.

It is important that you and your partner work towards having more open and honest communication about the risks of having unsafe sex. You can be safe and enjoy sex. You can be scared and still"

Once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.First, car accidents are common, and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us.   When we have an accident we feel anxious, worried, and may have some trauma after the accidents.  If you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident, talk to your doctor or therapist about it.  Second, a lot of people fail classes, tasks, deadlines, etc. but they don’t give up on their goal.  We have to remember that failing is part of the learning process, and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character.  Remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job, and the courage and determination that took to do so, then channel that energy back into school.  Third, when we have problems in our relationships, is helpful to look for ways to improve communication, discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them, but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isn’t enough interest in one of the parts or if there’s verbal or emotional abuse.  Consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communication.At all times:  focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem: increase selfcare activities, do more things that you enjoy, meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life.

Having a friend by your side when you go to public places and give yourself a verbal cue (e.g., I feel uncomfortable when I think people are looking at me) is going to be much more effective than trying to combat the anxiety all by yourself. Also, make sure you tell your friends that you appreciate their concern and that you are really grateful for their support.

Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams don't always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up ""Guided Meditation for Sleep"" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search ""Nightmare Rescripting"" or ""Nightmare Exposure"" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

Thank you for your question. There are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel
connected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if
we feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. 
I don’t know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you
believe that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority. 
Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings,
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say “no” to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with. 
I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, “sex
trust.” Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they
won’t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having.  Your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important. 
Now, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM
and may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles
are better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. 
Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but
again, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is
also important to know that BDSM is not just one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,
then you shouldn’t feel obligated to do it.
 
I hope this was helpful. Be well.
 
Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",0,116,train,"This is completely normal. What he has said to you is completely normal and is definitely a part of who he is. If you are interested in BDSM intercourse, it is completely normal to be concerned about the relationship because you have no way of knowing how this would play out in the future, what boundaries he may have in place, how you would communicate what you like and disliking, etc. He has specifically said he is interested in BDSM intercourse, so it would be unfair of me to tell you otherwise. I will tell you that this type of behaviour is not healthy for a long-term relationship, so if you are interested in continuing the relationship, I would recommend ending it immediately."

Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low selfesteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: ""I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed"". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful.

I recommend reading up on what exactly anxiety is so you can learn more ways to decrease anxiety and what types of actions you can take to help yourself when you feel like anxiety is affecting your life. Here are a few things you could try:
- Meditate. Meditation can help calm your mind. It’s a low impact activity that anyone can do. Many studies have shown that those who do meditation have lower blood pressure.
- Do fun things. New experiences can help decrease anxiety. When you get excited for something new, your body gets a natural dopamine high, and your brain doesn’t know to expect that high. Spend time with your friends and family, exercise, go to a museum, volunteer at a non-profit, sign up for a hike that interests you, read a book that has complex ideas, do something that challenges you (such as paint a canvas, climb a mountain, play a sport you aren’t normally good at, or take a class).

Chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event, the chain of events ((links) that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack, and then what the consequences were.  See the illustration below:This is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior (panic attack), allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations (prompting events) and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur (consequences).  Finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities, such as not enough sleep, poor nutrition, trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred.  Working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach, such as DBT or behavioral analysis, you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events.",2,214,train,"Fear of the unknown can create anxiety.

One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example ""I'm scared of spiders."" But if you change the thinking from being scared to ""I'm bigger than the spider,"" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. Mindfulnessbased therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. Instead of avoiding distressing thoughts, open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.Although it may seem counterintuitive, fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts. You can practice responding to disruptive thoughts, and letting these thoughts go.By remaining present in the body, you'll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats. By positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response.",0,284,train,"Your brain does a deep dive into your feelings and memories to try and understand why you are feeling anxious. I recommend journaling to get to the core of what is causing your anxiety. For example, sometimes writing out a list of all of the reasons you feel anxious can help. Often, having a specific memory of feeling anxious can help us understand our feelings better. Try to be as specific as possible when writing down your memories. One strategy to help reduce anxiety is to take deep breaths. Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth can help calm us down. We can also try mindfulness exercises like taking a walk in a forest or going for a drive in the country."

which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response).  This system
is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.  It is largely an unconscious function, but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations.  One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the
challenge with success.  You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it. 
With that being said, finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help.  Working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well. Good luck!",1,152,train,"This happens to me all the time! I haven't figured out yet what triggers it, but I'm going to guess that it has something to do with the volume of the voices in the crowd, or how nervous you are. Some people might say that you should just think of these moments as practice, but for me, it's still anxiety-inducing. It makes it really hard to be present, and that can lead to saying things that you might not otherwise say, or even making mistakes. So the best advice I can give is to remember that it's totally normal to be nervous in public, and to try to manage your stress so that you stay calm. It can be difficult, but I promise it will get easier with practice."

It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.",0,113,train,"This sounds like a stressful experience, and it's possible that your sleep pattern has something to do with it. When you are dreaming repeatedly, it could be that your mind is forming some connection, but your brain is not able to remember it. It could also be that your brain is suffering from sleep deprivation and simply does not have the resources to remember all of the dreams. I would recommend trying to reduce your overall amount of nighttime dreaming. Avoid overly bright or dark lights when you are sleeping to reduce the amount of time that your eyes are open, and limit the amount of time that you are awake before going to sleep. This should reduce the number of dreams that you are able to have. If none of this helps, it's possible that you could have a memory loss condition. This is something that doctors can test for, but I would not attempt to treat this on my own, as there could be other contributing factors. You should speak with a doctor."

552,552,552,215,How can I be less anxious when dealing with my toddler?,"My toddler defies everything I say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything.

Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens. Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter ""do this now"", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say ""let's get you dressed"", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says ""no"". You can say ""ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later."" The choice is hers. Then follow through.""When...then"" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try ""as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack"". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it. Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use selftalk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!",2,316,train,"When you feel like you’re in control all the time, it’s likely because you perceive situations out of your control, so it makes you feel that way. You can take control of this by learning to distinguish between what you control and what’s out of your control. Here are some techniques for doing that:

* Think about situations when you feel out of control. Describe those to someone else (if your kid is around). You might be able to pick up on these situations where you feel out of control without even realizing it.
* Keep a to-do list of items that are out of your control. For example, “work” and “childcare” are both out of your control. You can still do your work and spend time with your kid, just not all at the same time.
* Adopt a “I have no control” stance and say things out loud (like “I don’t think this will help at all” or “this definitely feels weird”). 
* Try relaxing a little bit. If you feel anxious all the time, try reducing the tension in your body, like by breathing more deeply."

You feel selfloathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). This current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness.  I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path?

Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important  not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin  others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort  putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone  remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway.

That is a good motivation for you to meet someone and to lose your virginity as soon as possible. You have good social skills, and you can use that to meet people.

Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries.  In effect, assertiveness communication becomes it's own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem.

That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a todo list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!",2,135,train,This is a good feeling

Recently however, it's been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind. It isn't possible for me to get professional one-on-one help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing more severe body image and self-confidence issues, which I have had all my life. I feel invalidated by my dad. I have been more paranoid lately as well. I can't turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He makes me feel guilty about it.

It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional (despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment). I would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area. Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that he/she may help mediate the conversation with them.If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents. Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enough.Good luck!,0,148,train,"You mention that your parents (and your dad in particular) seem to be pushing you to the point of doing/feeling things you don't want to do/feel. You're probably a strong person, but your parents are acting as if you are incapable of making your own decisions and they have to guide you. You need to put your foot down and tell your father that you will no longer put up with this sort of behavior. I would suggest scheduling a meeting with your father. Ideally you want this to be at his place and you want to come to it yourself (don't hire a lawyer!), but if that's not possible, at least set up the call to be as confrontational as possible."

I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck!

I can imagine how hard it is. I wish there was something I could do to help. I'm not sure if leaving your girlfriend would make your panic attacks better or worse, but I do know that she is probably the strongest person you know who would not tell you to leave youself unless it was absolutely necessary. I would call her and I would listen to what she has to say. Then I would take what she tells me to heart and try to be gentle and patient with myself until I could decide it would be safe to leave. Also, I would search out a couple of good therapists who could help you both explore your feelings and figure out what will make you feel safe and be safe. Take some deep breaths, follow the guidance of your therapists and try to let go of your desire to leave your girlfriend. You will get through this. Just be kind to yourself and remember that there are enough available beds at the end of the night for you to sleep safely in a new place. I hope this helps and please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any other questions. Good luck to both of you."

I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting ""Ohm"" to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.I hope this helps and best of luck to you.",3,150,train,"I am so sorry that you have self-rejected all medications and have an anxiety disorder.

Between a demanding job, family responsibilities, and everything else that can come up, stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life. One of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies, social lives, and overall well being is to engage in selfcare. But not the selfcare that most people think of like vacations or massages. The best selfcare is the kind that helps you live the life that you already have rather than escape it. You see, the reason why vacations and massages don't work long term in reducing stress is that they allow you to escape from what is causing the stress without truly fixing it so you just return to what already stressed you out. So, instead you need to find ways to help live with the stressors that you already have. They can be things like creating a more manageable schedule, introducing healthy eating or exercising, financial planning, and even learning a few simple relaxation skills. The key to combatting stress is to make small but consistent changes to your life so that it becomes more manageable and more enjoyable.",0,25,train,"First, ensure you are getting enough sleep.

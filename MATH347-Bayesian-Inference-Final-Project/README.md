# Vassar College MATH 347 - Bayesian Inference Final Project

### Data
- Player and Team Data from past 2 seasons from Basketball Reference 
- Instagram Follower Count: Python Scraper (e.g. BeautifulSoup)
- Variables / Features (46 variables: All Numerical) 

### Part I
- Implement and observe how “Naive Bayes algorithm”, a Bayesian algorithm which uses the Bayes rule, works in practice with real world dataset (NBA Dataset)
- Test if Naive Bayes works well with our NBA Player dataset (e.g. accuracy, f1-score) and also in comparison to other classification algorithms
- See which factors / features are influential in determining which player becomes an all-star player

### Part II
- Inference Question: Do players in certain positions (e.g. Center, Guard, Forward) have more instagram followers, on average, than those in other positions?
How do prior and posterior distributions compare to each other?
- How do we choose priors? Which model should we use?
- If we use the hierarchical model, for which position is the shrinkage / pooling effect the most prominent? What does this mean?

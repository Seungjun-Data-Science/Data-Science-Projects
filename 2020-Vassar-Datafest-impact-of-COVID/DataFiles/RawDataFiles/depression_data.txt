"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2193,doqwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,172,1572389522.0,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression

Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,1775,g1jxci,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1jxci/perhaps_whats_worse_than_depression_is_not_being/,70,1586949193.0,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it.",Depression
A cop stopped me from killing myself last night,309,g1njdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1njdn/a_cop_stopped_me_from_killing_myself_last_night/,21,1586965881.0,"A bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. I just feel like I have nothing and no one to live for. I’ve been really struggling lately. The people I count on to come and talk to when I feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so I’ve stopped bothering texting them. The only girl I’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. So I stopped texting her as well. No one bothers checking on me so why should I reach out to them? My aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. And my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. I was seeing a therapist but stopped because I couldn’t afford it. They care more about money than the health of their clients. America summed up in one sentence I guess. 

I dropped out of engineering school in October after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because I just didn’t wanna do it anymore. I was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. I may or may not go back. My student loans are due starting in June which I can’t afford. I have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that I never wanted in the first place with money that I don’t have. I only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which I much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. I just absolutely fucking hate being told what I can and can’t do with my own damn car that I pay for 100% myself. My car is my therapist and my favorite thing that I own. I’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. I cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. It’s been a month since quarantine and I can’t really even leave my house. Can’t have a social life. Just feel like I have no one to turn to and I’m drowning. Every fucking day and I’m just done. 

I left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. I waited til my family had all gone to bed, then I got in my car and just took off. I drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. I eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. I got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone I felt. I was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when I heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. I knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. I just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. He approached with a flashlight and noticed me. Apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. He was a young guy, probably about my age. He asked for my license and registration which I gave him. I’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and I think he picked up on the fact that I seemed a bit off. He asked me how I was doing and what I was doing so far from home at this time of night. It was like 1 am at this point. I just said that I needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually I admitted that I had driven up here to kill myself. 

I thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. He asked why and what was going on in my life. He even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. I had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how I felt like I had no one. He didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. I eventually said I planned to drive my car off this cliff because I was so unhappy. He was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. Apparently he came close to suicide a few times. A quote he said really stuck with me. It was “Sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” And it hit me that that was exactly how I felt. He gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if I needed to talk. We sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. It was so nice to just vent to someone. 

Eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what I just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. He walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. He walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. He followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while I got on the entrance ramp. I drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. I never even got his name or badge number. 

I got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. I snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. I gave no indication to my family that I tried suicide the night before. No one knew that I went out last night. I still haven’t told them and I don’t plan to. They have no idea that I could’ve died. I called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. He texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. I have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. Everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. 

It’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, I don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. His compassion saved my life. It’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. He deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. I owe him my life. Cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. We wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. I don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. I could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. Not a bad idea. Godspeed officer. I’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.",Depression

I dont want to play or interact with the kids. I just dont care. I want to care... but my brain doesn't care.

I dont care about my wife anymore. The love I had when marrying her is long gone.

I dont want to do the enormous pile of dish washer loading and unloading 4 times a day because she keeps eating and never cleaning up afterwards.

I dont want to empty and hang up clothes and load the washer twice a day because they keep making a mess.

What I want is to either be totally separated from them and just pay the child support for 18 years, and completely independent and on my own.

I miss the days where I could wake up on a day off whenever the fuck I wanted to. I could game for hours on end and have fun with buddies online.

I used to go out to bars with work buddies or my entire work department and have a great time after a week of work, chat up the ladies, just enjoy life.

I fucking hate being at home. I look forward to work every single day now. I'd rather be there working and away from my family.

But on the flip side.. I feel an insane amount of guilt and anger with myself for feeling like this. It would be a lot easier to just fucking kill myself.

I most of the time rather be dead than do the separation option because Its selfish and awful of any man to do that to someone and still be alive living their life while the ex wife does all the heavy lifting alone knowing that her partner just up and left and didn't give a shit.

At least if I'm dead she can take out her anger on the fact that at least I'm dead and not out there living, which would make her feel worse.

I'm so fucking tired... tired of the hallucinations, the meds that dont work, regularly overdosing my meds trying to get them to work cos I cant see a shrink anymore thanks to covid, waking up feeling like I've been bashed in the face with a hammer every day while my daughter is yanking my arm to get up and do boring shit like play with fucking toys I could not give 2 shits about, watching crappy cartoons on repeat, making her food and then she barely eats any of it so what's the fucking point, all while trying to stand up with a head that feels like it's been blown off.

I'm tired of everyone. I'm tired of my dickhole parents always trying to keep in contact when I've made it clear I dont wanna know them anymore. I'm tired of hearing that the distant family members are sending me messages to say hi when I haven't spoken to them for years since they traumatised me and fucked me over.

I'm tired of trying to get in touch with another friend who regularly thinks of ending his life and trying to calm him down, tired of trying to keep in touch with childhood buddies who just up and abandoned talking to me when I moved.

FUCKING TIRED. I just wanna live like Jimmy in the Wire. Shithole apartment with one room and a mattress on the floor and my smartphone and maybe a TV. Bag of clothes in the corner. Eat when I'm out. Drink lots. Smoke weed or do some drugs. Go to titty bars, and if I cant do that.... fuck it, I'm jumping. Everyone in the world... humanity... go fuck yourself.

Hallucinations

Hi! I’ve been on Sertraline for almost a year now. On 150mg a day. I’ve been to hundreds of doctors as I keep neglecting my treatment and moving but each dr increases my dose and pushes me out the door.

Recently I’ve been having severe symptoms, I’ve been really strongly visually hallucinating. I’m not talking about like an odd shape I literally imagined the floor crumbling underneath me and was convinced I was going to drop in to hell. I saw stuff like the world look like I was trapped in a game, and lots of dark haunting scary looking people. In the night I kept walking up as I was certain I heard someone walking in the house and kept seeing someone walk in to the room who wasn’t there. I’ve been having severe tremors so sometimes I can’t pick anything up and I wake up in the night soaked in sweat. 

I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? Do you think this could be the tablets?",Depression

Things were a bit weird after this but nothing too noticeable. Looking back, this is when my life went from being colourful to slowly fading away. I’m no brain expert but I feel like my brain was so deeply traumatised that it changed into some sort of safety mode, causing me to feel NOTHING and empty, all the time.

My symptoms;
- I feel empty all the time. I can’t remember the last time I felt any emotion, good or bad.
- anhedonia ( I cant remember the last time I really felt pleasure from anything )
- no sex drive what so ever (this wasn’t the case before the accident) 
- erectile dysfunction 
- basically I can’t feel anything, it’s like my brain doesn’t react to anything that happens anymore. I don’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed.
-I can’t cry, I sometimes lie in bed trying so hard to cry but nothing happens.
- I used to have a sense of self, I feel like a walking dead body now with nothing going on inside of me
- constantly fatigued and don’t care about anything 
- loss of imagination and my thoughts are so distant and empty

I’ve tried Zoloft on a 100mg dose for 3 months and felt no change what so ever in me. I’ve tried mirtazapine 30mg for 3 months and nothing happened other than appetite increase.

Please help, I’d love to be the old me again.

First off, my family has a history with depression. I know my grandmother has it, my father has it, and my grandfather may have had it too. Ever since middle school just year after year I felt worse and worse. Now I'm 23 with one good real life friend (who is my best friend) and one good online friend. Been single for like 7-8 years and just hate it. A long time ago had some of my old friends confide in me about being suicidal (even my best friend) and I tried to help them out the little I could (fortunately they're still with us). Though that's left me with no one I felt like I could turn to.   
Once out of high school I felt like I was in a swamp. Its thick muddy waters that makes it hard to move in. While you got all sorts of dangerous creatures like alligators and snakes watching your every move. On top of the blood sucking mosquitoes and leeches that latch onto to you day after day. At first I'd try my best to move forward you know, try to get somewhere, to get out of the swamp but no matter how hard I tried, how fast I moved, I always wound up back in the same spot of the swamp. I'd see lights and hear voices and I'd go toward them and yell out with my arm reaching for anything, but nothing ever happened and again I was in the same spot. As days went on, my will to move forward, call out, reach out, all faded away. But I'm an insane fool, and every so often I try again, reaching, moving, yelling, only to end up back in my little spot. I get rid of the leeches and swat the mosquitoes and even chase away the snakes but I don't bother with the alligator. Cause I wake up every morning, wishing that I didn't. Every day it feels like I look at that alligator and ask ""Why haven't you eaten me yet?"" and I never get an answer.  
So I'm just standing still, in my little spot. Watching as things go by, and people pass me. Waiting for the day where either someone finally pulls me out or the day that gator finally gets me.",Depression

Basically, it talks about how a minority of people with depression/anxiety are actually feeling better in the midst of this pandemic.

The causes of what I'm feeling aren't really talked about in the article, but I mention it for some context.

This pandemic is inflicting widespread suffering and I would give back every moment I've had of happiness so that it'd go away this instant. But like..I'm feeling pretty good? 

I think it's because in times of crisis, humanity tends to come together. I've communicated more with my friends in the past few weeks than I normally do. We've played MarioKart and Animal Crossing online, we've video-called, we're starting up a tabletop game...I haven't been allowed in sink into my depressive habit of isolating myself and then wondering why no one will reach out to me.

I just don't understand why am I different from others. Other people get wished even weeks before their bday. What would they lose in just remembering a date, 15 April.
Why is it that I don't get the same amount of happiness as others get. I have never even hurt anyone.

I've had (diagnosed) anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. It was not triggered by anything bad in my life, stress, or negative attitude. It was sudden. It's been theorized by some doctors that it's due to one of the many concussions I've had over my lifetime. I've tried everything from behavioral therapy and therapy sessions to almost every class of antidepressant. Yes, exercising and eating healthy too, etc. I've settled on one medication that's been the best so far. 

&#x200B;

Therapy helped for a while, but I haven't been able to find a replacement therapist that has helped. Therapy only helped me deal with the problems caused by my depression, not my depression itself.

&#x200B;

At my best, I'm a little anxious and somewhat normal, but never completely ""normal"". This is the case for 2 to 4 weeks. I then get a bout of depression that lasts 1 to 2 weeks. It is unprovoked and nothing seems to delay or prevent it, even regular exercise and healthy habits. I cannot stop it. My life is a cycle of several ""okay to good"" weeks followed by a couple of really low weeks. I tried self-medicating with marijuana for a while. It puts a damper on the tough weeks but doesn't help me continue living normally. I stopped using it.

&#x200B;

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the past five years. I've seen several therapists, most of them dismissing my case as a minor case.

I lost my mind. I saw red. And all I could think was fuck everything and fuck everyone. 

My best friend suffered a tragedy beyond words in December. The father of her unborn child and her partner hung himself. She was 8 months pregnant and found him in their brand new house, had to take him down and give him
CPR While he died in her arms. It’s been traumatizing. I have had conversations with her that have been more heartbreaking than most things I’ve heard in life. 

Easter Sunday we’re all having a great morning and my sister brings up that she’d like to give my friend at $250 target gift card to help. My dad out of nowhere says “$250? That’s some bullshit.” Everyone was stunned. no one said anything until I spoke up and said “why is that bullshit? To help my best friend whose struggling really bad right now and is so depressed and sick that she is on short term disability bc she’s not ready to go back to work. Then to save face in front of everyone, he started to lie. Just straight lie and act like he had no idea who jasmine was (he’s met her several times she’s been my friend for over a decade) tried to act like he had no idea about the situation (completely lies. He knew everything about it. He was there when I went to the funeral and asked a bunch of questions and I cancelled a lot of things during this time to support her) and made me look like a crazy person for being upset.

Mind you- my dad and I have had a strained relationship for awhile. My husband and I have been living in my parents basement for a year to try to save and he has made servers really fucked up comments besides this one- called me a fucking asshole bc I questioned something he said Under his breath about me and yelled a berated me in front of my husband. Has been rude to my husband. Made snide remark after snide remark to the point where I’m completely anxious to even do upstairs or be around him bc he’s just mean. 

My mom and I have always been close. She didn’t say anything to him during this incident. And basically said to me after I got upset “shut up. I am trying to enjoy my Easter.” Okay yeah bc I wasn’t trying to enjoy my Easter right ? This morning I made an order at a wine store and she went off on me telling me that I haven’t asked her if she’s wanted anything from any stores when we’ve gone out and basically calling us selfish. Let me be clear- I’m about the least selfish person ever. And I forgot to ask 1 time. We have been out of the house maybe 5-6 times total and I sent her screen shots when I and my husband have asked her if she needed anything. I just couldn’t believe she has the nerve to call me selfish after all this had gone down and I haven’t heard a word from her or my dad about Sunday. No apologies. Nothing. 

So I lost it. Everything came to a head. I am in so much pain and have been for over a decade. I take meds daily. I see my psych and therapist regularly. I try so hard to better myself and be a good person, daughter, sister, wife everything and everyone just seems to want to shit on me. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know what I ever did to deserve this. I feel like I was born by mistake. My sisters never get shit. Literally never. My oldest sister can basically do no wrong- yet I’m supposed to be having a wedding in 5 months and she hasn’t done a damn thing or asked anything about it and she’s supposedly one of my maid of honors. 

I first took 6 of my pills and then cut my arm with my razor. Not too deep and not too near my veins. I am so ashamed of myself. It’s been a really really long time since I’ve done that. The pain I felt. Watching it bleed. It just made me
Want to keep going and brought back all
The trauma I’ve had in my life. All the pain I stuff down every day and have for years. I am in so much pain and still no one cares. I’m just the brunt of everyone’s bullshit. And all I can think about it wanting to end it all. I love my husband so much and my two cats but the pain is so deep that sometimes I don’t even think about how their lives would be effected if I died. And he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand the pain. 

I’ve bandaged my arm. 6 pills were not enough to do anything but make me really tired and numb to my emotions- I did email my doctor. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I just need a hug. I need someone to tell me that I’m not crazy and that I have a right to be upset and feel hurt. My feelings do matter. That my life is important. I tried to text my mom that I wanted to die and she basically got more mad at me and gave me an ultimatum to talk or not and then continued to say I was ridiculous for wanting to die bc she got mad at me about the grocery order. She knows good and well that was just the straw that broke the camels back in my current depression. 

Sorry for the ramble. I just needed to vent. I needed someone out there to here me. Someone to let me know it’ll be okay.

Throughout high school, my main problem was trying to find that coveted word, online and in person, failing over and over and over. It was a passion equal to my true passion, fiction writing. 

Over the years, I've come to realize how it's pointless to waste energy on romantic love. Time and time again, I find the energy I put into that is the energy that should be veered toward actual important endeavors. 

Although the desire isn't nearly as strong as it was in high school, I still desire it and I still fear having it taken away from me, which seems to be the case now. What I realize after a post I saw on FB one day is that, I could have and can be working near my highest potential if I'd let that part of me go. Surely, I'd feel less depressed if I stopped putting my worth in that sickening want. It would be a weight lifted off my shoulders.

I've always been an optimist, all my life I've always tried to look for the bright side of things. And it's the same way now, sometimes I convince myself. But then there is days like these where everything comes crashing down, and I remember how I was bullied by everyone. And how I always felt like shit, I remember all the ""friends"" I used to have that would call me ugly and ignore everything I did, and just laughed at my face. I remember my ex and the abuse I went from her and how no one supported me, ever.

But I don't want to be depressed, I know I sound like an asshole but I think suicide is about the dumbest thing you can ever commit. Why kill yourself when your already gonna die? Why not live life to the fullest and let death come naturally? 

But even though I have those thoughts there is always that other voice in my head. A voice that you can barely hear, you'd have to really listen to be able to hear it. It keeps telling me to kill myself over and over again it says, what's the point in being alive when no one likes you, when all your friends hate you. Your a nobody, stop being alive.

On most days I can barely hear the voice I ignore it, but then there is those days where I wake up and cry and it's like the voice had climbed over the thousands of walls I've put up and its shot the thousands of little guards that I call rational thought. And it's THERE, it's taken over everything.

But I'm still a little strong I can pin that thought down and throw it back to the back of my mind. But it's words still haunt me.

Hi all,1,g21fj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g21fj7/hi_all/,0,1587015736.0,"
I am 20 years old male
I came across a health issue 6 months ago and how I dealt with it is.. eye opening.

I had some stomach issues stem up. There was a thought in my mind that I had bowel cancer because I had all the symptoms, blood in stool, constipation, you name it. The night before my blood tests and a stool test that looks for blood, I cried thinking about it. What was I thinking about? I was imagining that the doctor says they found what I was fearing. Then I started thinking what I would tell my family. Would I lie? Say that I love them all and they have been all I ever wanted and more? 

Or would I tell the truth? Would I tell them how I truly felt about them? Maybe so they could change? Would I tell them that I don’t mind if something in my bowels is gonna kill me?

I mean, I am not going to lie, when I had that fear from built up anxiety, I actually wanted to live. I really did. But here I am months later, back to my normal life. Why did these feelings go? Why can’t I get this feeling when I am healthy? Why am I suicidal now, but when I was close to “death” I wanted to live so badly?

Mind you, this is not the first night that I felt this way. I’ve had uncountable nights and days that I had this feeling. In fact, 6 years ago when I was 13 I dreamed that I blew my h*** off with a shotg** in the balcony. Then I turned into a ghost and went inside my house, telling my family how Sorry I am but nobody replies or sees me. I woke up crying. Since that dream I promised myself I would never do such a thing. My thoughts might say that theyre better off without me, but I know, from that dream, that if I go that way I won’t make anything better.

for those who didnt watch, relationship of main character gem with her father is the key point of the movie. shes salty, shes pissed, she hates him most of the time but ends up forgiving him before he passes away.

and all that got me thinking of how much my life is ruined now and beyond fixing because my father was doing what he wanted all the time. usually it was drinking and trying to hit the jackpot. he spend all his life being given things, so he wanted to be rich easly too. except... then he would waste it all to get drunk. and its been always like that, aside from threats about killing my mom flying around the house, broken plant pots, plates and other stuff. he chilled now but im still here stuck with him.

and i cant even think of what i lost because of him. my childhood, my possible friendships, my possible romance, my holidays and vacations, my education, three years wasting away at home and then another three of wasting away and *sometimes* going to shit job that i hate with horrible pay. and all this is still continuing and i cant start living because lol... for what money

i cant even have good paying job because im hs dropout. i dont have driving license either. i started the course to get it two years ago but i didnt pass two exams and quit trying... thats pretty telling about me

Don’t know how to be more disciplined / productive and don’t know where the boundary of ADHD / Depression ends and when me being undisciplined starts)

Hi. So two years ago I basically was on the top of my game. I was doing really well in school (then a junior in high school), got the job of a lifetime, and had awesome productivity / work life balance. This was also my first year in school being diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive, Anxiety, and Depression. (diagnosed end of sophomore year)

Everything fell apart. I lost the job, my dad went to hospital, I accumulated debt by borrowing money from friends while sustaining myself while my dad was in the hospital, grades died, etc.

My dad is now fine, and I’m recovering in most aspects in a stable way except my productivity and discipline. 

(BIG NOTE: My medication has never really been a good thing. I used to be on meds but I haven’t taken meds regularly in a long time. My meds make my heart rate go crazy and generally worsen every aspect of both my ADHD and Anxiety and essentially only works after the meds wear off and I’m on the come down.)

I have so many aspirations. I want to continue doing design. I want to pursue music too. I want to do well in school. I want to continue to watch a ton of YouTube and anime and such and be cultured and on top of what’s going on in the world right now. Yet this is an example of how my days have been going.

10 AM: I wake up. 
1 PM: I work out
10 PM: I finish some assignments that are dude before midnight
12 AM: PS4 / Anime
3 AM: Bed

I don’t know where the time goes. I don’t really enjoy my time, nor am I productive. My friends give me advice which I read and agree that it’s logical but yet i still find myself at the end of the day asking what did I just do.

\----------------------

I just don't want to live. No one understands that, everyone keeps telling me shit that my life is just about to start. Like saying that my problems maybe doesn't matter because I'm young (18). I'm scared that life may be even worse than today. I've been suffering from depression for a really long time (I stopped being happy when I was 4th grade, wanted to kill myself since 6th grade). Everyone in my primary school was bullying me and telling me stuff I'm ugly, weird and sometimes they were throwing stuff at me. There was once a boy that kept kicking my legs but I don't remember exactly why. When I graduated from this school to another, the bullying just didn't stop. They were bullying me because I was poor and my family had financial problems. When I moved to another town I had strong trust issues but everything was fine. I felt like everything is about to change to better.

But it didn't.

I found my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were with each other for almost 2 years. I felt loved and I would do then everything for him just to feel loved. I was very jealous of him. Something like yandere tbh but I don't think so, I just wanted to be with him forever and show everyone that I can be in relationship (I remember when one of girls from my class in primary school told me that I'm so ugly and disgusting that even a pedophile wouldn't touch me). So I did. Until he started insulting me in a very vulgar way but mostly he called me ""a fucking ameba"". He also started to be nice to me but only when we had sex. I couldn't satisfy him when I tried to pleasure him. He was also trying to flirt with my lesbian acquaintance. In front of me. Many times. I didn't want to end this relationship because I thought that I will never find a partner again and I will be forever alone. But I finally decided after all this long time of pain. I told him to fuck off. I cried for a long time but for now I just feel disgusting that a person like him has touched my body. No worries, he never raped me nor molested me. I just feel bad that someone like him touched me.

After some months I went to the mental hospital because I was feeling really suicidal. I've been here for about 3 weeks. People were bullying me there because I was annoying to them and one girl even told me that I should just kill myself and everyone will be happy. They were laughing at me because ""I couldn't handle the truth"". My mom took me out from there even though my doc wanted to keep me for two weeks more. Yes, she knew what was happening to me during my stay in this stupid hospital.

When I was there someone from my classmate's discord told me they can keep me company during this hard time. It was my future boyfriend. We were with each other for some months. He broke up with me because he felt that he has feels for a girl that he knew for a long time. I felt sad but he never hurt me, so I decided just to let him go. I didn't want to be annoying or something.

And now we're here. Me, depressed and bored, who doesn't want to get better because I know it won't work. It never worked. And this coronavirus stuff is making me even more depressed. I wanna die but something from this virus just bugs me. I'm just... lost, ugh. Everything pisses me off.",Depression

Am I depressed/suicidal?,1,g20065,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g20065/am_i_depressedsuicidal/,1,1587011161.0,"I don't want to kill myself but I also really don't want to live my life. A little bit about my thought process. 

I've had mixed feelings on this label. I'm the kind of person who won't test for something so that it doesn't exist. Like dyslexia, I was offered a test in Uni and didn't take it because the answer is no I don't have dyslexia until proven otherwise.

I have this same mentality with depression. I also wouldn't even know where to start. people say go see a gp but I've never had one and I'm not in a position to see one without my family asking questions. 

I'm also not into self-diagnosis and would never say I have depression. I may be depressed or feeling down from time to time but I just don't know.

I've always been self-aware and existential (if that's even a word). I've always thought why this life. Why am I in this body. Why do I have these feelings, these emotions and these motivations or lack of movitation. I feel like there should be a grand scheme to things but I can't dedicate myself to one with no evidence. I'd love to believe in reincarnation but what's the point if you cant remember a past life. Id love to believe in afterlife but like does that mean for 80+years you get on earth you get an eternity of just watching sounds tedious. I'd love to believe in heaven but then does that mean there is a hell.

Anyway down to the main point. I'm going to try and put this into words but I don't even know what to call it. I am not suicidal, I don't want to kill myself but at the same time I don't want to carry on living. 1. I don't think I would kill myself 2. Even though I'm meh on my family I wouldn't put them through that 3. If a truck ran me over next week my instant thought would not be ""no i have so much to live for""

I feel like I'm done with life. I don't want to carry on. I don't want to make decisions that could backfire. I don't want to make a wrong move and regret my past (although I hardly regret things). I don't want to try and get out of my funk and become social again. I've always struggled with friends, my relationships and my passions. My whole life is made up of; I want to do this  I pursue it, get so far and then for whatever reason its done - over with. I don't want to keep doing that.

Life is too much of a gamble and I just don't want to risk it. It's like a game and I'm done playing but I can't bring myself to quit. I don't enjoy playing I'd rather I naturally land on a square and go bankrupt and lose the game (monopoly). It's like I don't want to see what positives are out there I'm not ready to risk the negatives and the positives aren't enticing anymore I'd just rather not play at all. Even if someone said here's a free pass I'd rather just not do it.

There's too much unknowns in life and out of it. Does what I do with my life effect my afterlife if there even is one and ultimately do I care.

I really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this being so long I just felt like I need to put it into words and see if anyone has experienced similar things.",Depression

I've had depression for around 20 years now and it's just awful. I understand those who say it'll get better but when it does it's simply when is it going to go downhill again? I've been on the back and forth for years had 2 vehicles totally paid off had 2 jobs that I loved to work at, had the whole thing.

We live in a society that says we need things, people, drugs, or a certain outlook to have a happy life.
I don't want to be here anymore, I feel abused. Like I can never be myself because everyone has built up a perception of me and when I act like myself I'm ridiculed for being different or told that's not how it works or you can't feel that way.
The problem is I do feel this way and I always have, it's gotten to the point where I believe my own thoughts to be cancerous even if they make me feel better because I've been led to believe I have to be someone and something I just am not and every day I have to pretend that I'm ok and love this shit just feels like I'm slowly suffocating my real self.

I've even been trying to smoke cigarettes, which I fucking hate, just because I want to do damage to my lungs and have had asthma so I know they are getting fucked.

I feel like if I just leave this life behind, not suicide, then I could possibly become the person who I have always wanted to be. So i either can slowly watch myself rot and pretend to be alright, which what I've done for the last 15 years, or I attempt to try again somewhere else without any past, family or friends.",Depression

I'm someone struggling with depression since five years and have been lurking in this sub since a year or so. I've figured I won't be able to help anyone since I'm busy enough with my own thoughts, but I might as well post something interesting on here. Depression is a disease that tends to affect people with above-average intelligence, due to the fact that smarter people often overthink and/or start questioning themselves, life or even existence itself. 
I made a playlist and wondered why are we so obsessed with sad music, when listening to happy music would be the most logical thing to do. 
For anyone interested, my playlist consists of sad songs I listen to when times are difficult.
Link:
 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVw

First of all I gotta say that music is not a cure for depression and can even affect you in a negative way. The Playlist is just somthing I wanted to share.

So. Why do we like sad music?

When we listen to music we feel understood. We can see a glimpse of ourselves in the artist or song, that conveys the same emotions we feel. We feel better about our situation when we believe that someone else has experienced something similar and understands exactly how we feel. More importantly it validates our thoughts and makes us feel human and normal. At the same time, it allows listeners to bring their own negative emotions to the surface and vent them out, thereby reducing tension and stress.

Why do we hate listening to happy music?

As stated above, happy music would be the first logical thought at first, but often we do end up feeling worse than if we hadn't listened to happy songs. The best way to put it would be to compare both happy and sad with humans. The sad one is the understanding one who went through the same and is trying to console you, while the happy one is a annoying guy who always smiles at us and tells us to just cheer up and be happy.

Why do we like sad songs even when we're not sad?

Who in their right mind would choose a song that could heavily mess with their mood when there are happy alternatives out there?
Simply put is happy music often boring and fake. We as humans can't feel happiness for a extended period of time and get annoyed after a few songs.
Sad music is more moving and we connect to sad, romantic or even angry topics.

Effects of sad music on us:

""One might suppose that people become pessimistic when they’re sad; however, one research study proves that people are actually more realistic when they’re sad. This is due to a phenomenon called depressive realism. Compared with happiness, sadness has been observed to encourage more detail-oriented thinking and less judgment bias in people. Listening to sad music is believed to induce depressive realism, encouraging more realistic assessments of the likelihood of certain outcomes.""

Yet my mom and the rest of my family have always forced me to act like she was my saviour. No one likes it when I as much as try to bring up the fact that she was the one who cheated on him, she was the one who regularly left me alone with him, knowing full well he was making my life living hell.

When we left, that should've been the end of the pain. Not the ramp up; the part where the guitars start properly chugging and the LPFs are released.

And then she left. I was barely 13. She left to move to another city, because she wanted to live her life unbound by me. She wanted to date rich European men and hoe around. And that came at the cost of me being forced to spend the next 5-6 years of my life with my piece of shit paternal grandparents. Those who made clear that I was just a burden left on them unjustly.

All of this is a tiny, tiny, tiny part of my story, but it bears mentioning/ranting.

She does say she hopes I can find peace or whatever, but she won't ever allow me to be myself with her (which would be really helpful) and when she talks to me, it's like she completely ignores what I tired to say. She can't ever seem to understand me when I try to talk to her, and I really want her to. And I **always** feel worse after every conversation we have.

Anyways, we are talking as friends and I am slowly but surely becoming ok with not being together as we were. It was a short relationship though it was codependent so bonds were formed very quickly and strongly. 

When I close my eyes I imagine she's holding me, telling me everything will be okay, as she has in the past. I am having a hard time seeing this as a friendship even though I know that's what's best for us both. 

Do you have any advice on how to handle this alone and viewing her as a friend? Also, any ideas on other things I can imagine when that image pops into my head?",Depression
My brain can’t comprehend its own stupidity.,2,g1sjfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1sjfl/my_brain_cant_comprehend_its_own_stupidity/,1,1586988316.0,"I wasn’t always this stupid. A mixture of indulgence and bad timing made me like this. I was a smart kid and took it for granted. I had a general grasp on topics, but only took interests in sports, music, video games and girls. So dumb. I am utilizing none of these interests for my everyday life.

My father succumbed to cancer when I was 14 and I’m 22 now. He had it for 5 years prior and those years seemed to last decades and minutes at the same time. Decades because of how everyone approached me and treated me just because my dad had cancer. Minutes because of the knowledge I was able to extract from my dad. I always wish I asked more questions, but what did I know at that age. 

This dilemma stunted my growth into becoming who I am. I still don’t really know, honestly. I became numb to everything and stopped caring about my future because I didn’t know what life would be like without my best friend. It’s awful kid.

Now that I’m older and in my prime, I can only think about how I’ve wasted my life. Quitting college after a year, no girlfriend, no job and living at home again because of a pandemic. I don’t know where to go and I’m tired of pretending that life will find a way. Life’s “way”, leads me to more and more pain without any compensation. My patience for my death is dwindling daily.

I’m unable to live up to the standards society has placed on me. As a 22 year old male, there is obviously a lot of them. Want examples? Ok. I’m expected to be tough and never show emotions, can’t do that. I’m expected to know a lot about cars and tools and all that, I don’t know any of that. In relationships, I’m expected to “be a man” and provide for women, make all the first moves, chase after scary sounds and bugs, do heavy lifting, provide for her while she just gets to be comfortable, I definitely can’t do any of that. I’ve never even been in a relationship, as someone with high functioning autism/aspergers, dating is pretty much rigged against me, so is society as a whole really. Women are cared about and have all these people fighting for them, I wish I had people fighting for me, I matter to nobody. Women are always cared about when depressed but males are just told to man up and deal with it. I’ve always wished I was a girl. If some of that sounds sexist I really don’t care, it wasn’t, and if that’s how you took it that’s too bad. I don’t have the strength, mentally and emotionally to live up to these standards, never can, and I never plan to. Already planning to kill myself soon, I’m beginning to overcome my fear of death and by the end of the year I likely will. Life clearly wasn’t meant for me, and I don’t plan to stick around, especially in a world that hates me.

Finding comfort in your depression?,1,g1wqdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1wqdl/finding_comfort_in_your_depression/,1,1587001253.0,So I’ve been going to a therapist and a doctor for almost 1 1/2 years now and I feel like I haven’t made much progress aside from understanding myself better. On December my doctor prescribed Adderal to me for my depression and ADHD and it was pretty good in keeping me focused and being happy I guess. But I stopped taking it after like a week. I haven’t taken any medication or visited my therapist since. Mainly because I swore I was finally gonna go back to college but never did. I was too ashamed to go back showing I had barely any progress. Plus I stopped taking medication. I know it would help me greatly but for some reason I just don’t want to get into that funk of feeling good and I’m not sure why. Is it because I simply am to attached to being depressed? It sucks because I feel like people that start therapy and all that start making noticeable changes in only a couple months and I haven’t done jack in almost two years.

I'm gonna make a part 2 as well. 

&#x200B;

My first mistake was learning to speak, if only I were born a mute. 

I got used to being made fun of that I started to do it normally in my mind.

My brain is so broken that negativity is my one and only normal.

Talentless and below average in a sea of those who will always be better than me. 

One mistake can lead to others that feel like a slight burn. I'll continue to make them until I'm completely engulfed in flames.

Yesterday was great. Too bad those days are so rare. 

My feelings are toys to be played with and then forgotten after some amount of time. 

My mood is bound to change in an instant to negativity so that I may be comfortable. 

Do I conform so easily to others opinions or do I take bits and pieces from others? Either way, they never feel like my own.

I want to satisfy those at my own dissatisfaction. 

Why are we cursed with lives of self-doubt, contradicting, and hateful thoughts?

Wanting to always be right about failing, I will sabotage myself if doing well or flat out refuse. What a disgusting creature I am.

Why is that whenever I'm happy, depressing, and negative thoughts come by the multitude? Like a woodpecker at a tree, they pick at my brain until they're in and settled. 

Suicidal ideation was once my full time job. 

I want to say I'm sorry and that it's all my fault, although I'm not quite sure what for.

We're all hypocrites to some degree or another. 

A time for everything, but mine has been mostly sadness. 

To believe I was once complete and not broken into tiny little pieces. 

Don't hate me. I already hate myself. 

After wanting to change for so long, it's finally here. Now that it is, I want nothing more than for it to go away. 

I was never the lion like I wanted to believe. I'm the dog in the corner, whimpering and cold, only wanting to love and be loved back. 

I can look past others deformities but not my own. 

I can forgive everyone. I just can't forgive myself. 

Instead of overcoming my problems, I succumb to them. I want to blame someone for that. But everytime I look for that person, I end up looking in the mirror.

Never improving. Always failing. The essence of who I am.",Depression

Waking up every few hours from a nightmare about her to cold sweat and a pillow full of tears is taking its toll on me. I kept having the same nightmares every time I close my eyes. I kept seeing her with someone else in my nightmares and I know she’s probably with someone else in my reality too. It hurts the most when you know she has moved on. How could she move on so fast? We broke it off for a few days and she’s already talking to someone new. Was it really love if she could just move on that fast from a 5 years relationship? 5 years and it only took her a few days to start talking to someone new? I know I did many things wrong and I regret every single one of them, but how can she just throw away 5 years full of memories for a new person just like that? 

The pain is too much, my head hurts, my heart hurts, everything hurts. I’ve been spiraling with hard drug abuse and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I told myself I would never touch those substances ever in my life, yet here I am, abusing everything I could get my hands on.

She had blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her. It fucked me up knowing how I was the one she came to at 3am when she needed me the most, the one that I held on right when she had nightmares but also the one who disappeared when I felt the lowest and loneliest. 

I just hope I could call her and maybe hearing her voice would stop me from ending it all one day. Maybe she could convince me to keep living and the pain will subside. But for now, I hope it will look like an accident.",Depression

1- I don't care about isolation, I tend to be a lone wolf anyways, not having to deal with people in person is fantastic.  


2- I'm very very very close to putting a bullet in my skull. So here in Canada we have something called EI ( employment insurance ) and CERB.   


I've spent the better part of Oct onwards (Until around March) being unable to work due to a shoulder and ankle injury. I went into Jan telling myself that I can finally work again and not starve myself each month, then all this bs hit.  


Now because I didn't work, I'm not eligible for either the CERB or EI. Ditto for 100's in my situation, students etc.   


3- I've lost track of how many things I've punched this last few weeks. I know my knuckles are bruised up and me usually being civil and patient and friendly, has gone off the deep end and is about ready to put said bullet in my head.

Fuck man I'm getting so tired and I don't know how to express what I'm feeling and English is not my först language so this might be just me rambling incoherently and I'm sorry about that but I hope you can bare me out cause I really need to get this shit off my chest... 

My mom and dad split when I was very young 
My mom had 2 kids before me and a lie after me, all with different men and all of them bailed and left my mom with the kids(except my dad). 
She used a lot speed and gambled her way into debt and struggled alot with mental illness 
She couldn't handle everything so i moved to my dad and his new woman (I call her mom) and her daughter (my big sis) when I was 2. 
From there on I spent 1 week at my dad and then 1 week at my moms. So I was kind of the outsider of both of my families, this continued for quite a while, 2 different sides of life. 

1 week at my dads place, which was a nice smalltown with a nice daycare and school and 1 week with my mom and my now 3 other siblings (i got a new younger sister) wherever we lived at the moment ( she moved around quite a lot) 

I liked to be at my moms place, she wasnt as strict as me ex military dad but he had his reasons. But I spent my entire childhood going back and forth between two different worlds and missing out on both, not feeling like I was in center of anything, on my moms side I think I was seen with some resent for being able to live with my fancy dad and still being the most chaotic of us. And at my dads they saw me as a kid who couldn't behave. 

I was outside everywhere. Friend groups, family and just mentally alone, but god knows I tried, I tried way to hard and that fucked it up for me everytime but I tried. My parents hated eachother for so long and I was a pawn in my moms game and I ended up hating my dad for many years and I Will always hate myself for that, he was hard on me but he is a goddamn good dad and he tried. He even tried when I was a heavy drug user at 16 to 20 years old. He saw me take my older brothers (moms side) steps and he couldnt see all the mental problems I had and I don't blame him, he grew up where men didnt show that they suffered so it angered him. 

I was pretty good at masking my lonlieness with friends who liked that I did stupid shit and that I got angry easily. But Fuck I spent so many years crying myself to sleep and sleeping in the warmth of the shower. I just wanted to feel like I belonged. 
Fast forward to 2017 and many drugs and bad behaviour, my parents kicked me out and I spent a year couch surfing and sleeping rough until I met my girlfriend, half a year after my ex cheated on me with my friend and after I vowed to never trust love because I fall really easy and I have bad judgement but damn it was like the sky turned and I felt like home, I can't describe it but it felt like your soul got a warm close hug after staying at the bottom of a cold sea. All my self harm, all the cuts, all the drugs, every lonley night every single time I tried to make it over the edge of that fucking bridge, every overdose. It was all worth it and I would have done it 10 times over. She was so goddamn beautiful, and those eye man... those eyes. I would break every bone in my body just to look into those eyes and be certain that it was with love they looked back at me again.

The first mistake I made was that I went to fast, I moved in in under a month and I was blind to the signs. I know I fall for the broken type and you'd think that comes with a certain eye for when things are sketchy but no. It took me 4 months until I realised that she was cheating with multiple guys and I stood there outside the window and seeing her in panties on a guy on the couch. That was 2 years ago on the 9th of april and I'm too this day certain that a part of me died that night. I went in and picked up my stuff and went on my way to my first OD in a while. I survived. I licked my wounds for a while knowing I had to keep of the drugs I had already damaged my family, my mom my dad and my 2 angels ( my younger sisters) I couldnt get lost again, I needed them to see me happy and alive.

My girlfriend wanted me back and I couldnt walk away from that feeling I had before, even if that meant living with the old familiar feeling of never being someones number one. For a year forward I was treated like shit and still saw signs of infidelity until I caught her with more then just messages. She had been to a guys place pretty close to where we lived so I went to talk to him (She was at Home every day while I was working full time so we could survive) he told me they had met but nothing had happened, but that she had been coming on pretty strong but he didnt like her.

 I Think she was looking for a guy similar to the guy I first guy I caught her with... She would have done anything for him. It took her over a year to post that she was in a relationship with me because she was afraid what he would think. I did everything for her but he was still number one. 
Anyways... 

I confronted her and she told me she loved me now, forreal and she had problems and wanted to change so she changed (or cleaned up her act) and she worked on herself and slowly began to treat me better. But it never felt like she's really attracted to me like she had been to other guys, even then when really hot women came onto me I never gave or give anyone a single signal. Instead I'm always there for my baby, when she is down i leave work and come Home, when we fight and she turns it around to be my fault I say Im sorry, and its slowly killing my self respect. And now 2020 its much better between us and I have my son (my dog) who means the world to me and my family is so proud of me and everyone turns to me with their problems cause its easy to talk to me and I understand them but I'm so fucking lost, I'm a guy but why does noone hug me when Im down, why do a man have to ask his woman to go an extra mile to pick him up. Why is a man seen as annoying when he is needy? Why do only girls deserve romantic gestures that solidify what love someone have for them. Im so tired of being ashamed for being down and sad, for crying and not being able to pick myself up and be happy. Why don't I deserve to feel like I know where home is? I cant see a home in the world as it is and it breaks me every single day to wake up with this feeling, being surrounded by people but feeling like the lonliest man alive, deattached from everyone. I cant even sleep and find peace cause there are the nightmares and sleep paralysis waiting and the sleeping meds are a joke, the therapist meetings just makes me feel more alienated. I'm just so fucking lost

I have no one to turn to,2,g1rtl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1rtl2/i_have_no_one_to_turn_to/,3,1586985817.0,"I’m going through a hard time in my life (isn’t everyone these days).
I think I might be breaking up with my long term boyfriend. And I’m... pretty broken up about it. Constant, fat tears... I couldn’t stop shuddering... I was in physical pain and it felt like my chest was collapsing in on itself. The worst part about this is that he was my only friend. I literally have *no one* to talk to about this. I don’t have a support system. It was just him. I know that was unfair, but I was trying to change it. All of my friendships have fallen apart for various reasons that I had nothing to do with. I don’t feel close with my family. I didn’t mean to make him my only point of support. I guess it doesn’t matter now. I have no one to message and just talk to. Of all the people I do know, I’m not close enough to any of them to reach out. They’re not anything beyond surface level friends. It’s not their fault, or bad necessarily. They’re good people. I don’t blame them. I feel a sense of mourning. I never got to tell him that for months I have been thinking about how great it will be to put his towel in the dryer while he showers, but I didn’t want to tell him (and I’m terrible at keeping secrets) because I wanted to see the surprised look on his face. I’ll never see that now. I feel weird “mourning” the family we would have had and the life we would’ve built. Thinking about that makes me wonder if I’m making a mistake by stepping back, but talking to him right now is bringing such great emotional pain that I physically hurt. I never wanted this to happen. I was afraid something like it would. I’m realizing now that is what I’d be telling a friend if a had one. Now that I’ve slept a little and I’m sitting here... I feel this calm melancholy. My chest still hurts but I’ve stopped crying. I desperately don’t want it to be... but I think it’s over. I have this feeling, like... it’s hard to describe. I know I’ve been too much of a burden on him, and he’ll never directly tell me but being with him is too much for him and it’s hurting him. I’m hurting him by being with him because of the way I am. I question if I ever actually worked on myself... I think I did. But in hard times I have been melting a little, and I think it’s just too much. This, combined with som other crap that happened a little while ago, just makes me feel so... numb. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet to be honest. 
I love him so, so very much but the pain is just too much. Some of it isn’t his fault but I also feel like he could’ve taken a leap of faith for me, and didn’t, and I’m crushed. I thought I had shown that I would have his back, but thinking backwards in time to other conversations we’ve had, it’s clearer to me he doesn’t completely trust me for some reason and I don’t know why. His schooling means so much to me, I wouldn’t have gotten in the way of that... I would’ve done everything to help make it easy. Make help him staying here as comfortable as possible. I believed he’d want to stay, to weather this storm together... but I was wrong. Said he didn’t think it through enough. He talked to his family and they advised against it... I understand because of the circumstances... I feel like they mistrust me too... for some reason there was some perceived ill intentions in things went down... but I just wanted to see him. They said it was okay and after believing all this time he’d come be by my side, he said no. And it’s not just that he’s not here with me. He thinks I wouldn’t do everything and anything to help facilitate his success and help him thrive. I don’t know why. A long time ago, we were talking about something to do with school, and I can’t remember the specifics but he said something to effect of “I don’t trust you to not get mad at me for doing my work” or something. And I *heard* him, and I swear I wasn’t doing anything but being supportive of him going to school but he felt like I’d impede him. I was crushed then, we were sitting in my car but I made an excuse to go to the bathroom to go cry. I don’t know what I did to make him feel like he can’t trust me.... I trust him completely and it lead to my heart feeling so broken. I feel like a sore idiot for going on about being sad and “heart broken” but if you really think someone is the one and it gets messed up... I’m reeling. If I had known that the last time I saw him was gonna he the *last* time... I can’t think about it too much or I’ll just cry. I don’t really know what to say now. I tried to keep my cool so that he’d see I was trying to be responsible, and he’d see I was trying to be good. I didn’t want to lose my marbles and ask him why or be sad, I’ve ruined any chance of seeing him at all. None of this has properly sunk in. I don’t have to save my Instagram memes anymore, all of what I have saved is... just... nothing now. I’ll never get to hug him again, I can’t show him how much I care and that I’d never hurt him and that I want him to feel whole and happy... I’ll never get to live with him and warm his towels or have his beans or know what it’s like to be with him. I feel like I’m doing something rash... but there’s this weird calm... I think it has to be this way... he will be able to thrive without me, and I know he’ll be able to do his work with flying colors... I’m not worried about that. But I just feel so... lost.

I want to move up in my career but without a teacher, mentor, or even someone else in my field that I can go to, it's near impossible. 

I literally need someone to walk me through things, which people might see as hand-holding. I'm aware that people can't just walk me through life, but there's gotta be some kind of solution

I don't know anyone else who feels like this so is this normal? I WANT to want to learn, but straight up I do not want to learn a new skill. I know it will get me further in my career and my life, but I just can't bring myself to care.

What is depression,1,g1vyp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1vyp2/what_is_depression/,0,1586998933.0,"As someone who is depressed my opinion is that depression is just being repeatedly sad day after day due to lack of endorphines due to lack of anything for example if i suddenly met a girl (and ive never been in a relationship) that i liked i would get a natural release of endorphines causing me to feel good, do you think i would feel depressed at that moment? Then if that girl became my partner and i spent time with her every day i would get a release of endorphines so i wouldnt be depressed at those times, enough endorphine released could keep you feeling stable or happy for a few hours without any activity(i think), isnt it wrong for depression to be diagnosed and treated like a mental illness?",Depression

It's been bad before, but I think I've hit an all-time low  during the past weeks. Social and financial insecurity keep eating away at me, pressure from all sides to perform is crushing every will to go on, recent failures on search for jobs diminish every last bit of self-esteem and not being able to socialize during a damned pandemic takes away all my coping mechanisms. And finally, not having had a SO other to catch me for more than 7 years leaves me be lonely when times are toughest. Like that, I've been dragging myself from appointment to appointment with my therapist for the past weeks.

Yesterday, I burst into tears several times during the day, as I found myself reaching my limits. I wrote down all my thoughts and fealings to show my therapist today. 

After reading, he asked me if it would be possible that I'd end up hurting myself, or possibly worse, in my current situation. 

I've been thinking about this before, but never with any intent. My pride would never allow me to take that step. Also, I value myself and my life way too much to consider suicide. I'd rather have everything else go to shit and leave all things behind.

A family where I've been brought up quite freely. But talking about my experiences and feelings in 80% of cases ends in misunderstanding on their part, so I stopped sharing something deep with them. I'll get to the problem. It's based on the choice of future professions. Three years ago, when my peers were deciding who they wanted to be, I couldn't identify any traits and hobbies that might have been prerequisites for my adult life. My parents advised me to be a doctor, because I would always have money for ""bread"" and I wouldn't be lost or anything like that. Their ghostly beliefs imposed on me as a 15-year-old seemed convincing and I decided to get ready to go to medical university ... 3 years have passed. During that time, the thought that I was doing something wrong came to me occasionally. It was a year of passing exams with graduation and other formalities. The results of my exams were average, which did not satisfy my parents and I entered a higher education institution of our regional center, not a decent one. Even though I understood that my university was far from being prestigious, the understanding that my adult life had begun caused an ephemeral feeling of trembling before something new. But after two months of study, I began to realize that the university really sucks, because Russian education is one big disappointment (Yes, I am from Russia). I can tell you about the reasons. I feel devastated by broken expectations and an epiphany from the deep sleep I have been in all these years. I have no desire to learn.

A little background check - I am from an upper-middle class family, we live a decent life. The past 2 years have been very hard on me and I feel like 2020 is going to be even worse. I constantly fight with my parents for petty reasons and then I cry about it at night, I shout at them, and then regret it later. 2019 was a bad year, initially, till mid May, I was suicidal, I even put a blade to my wrist but somehow I stopped myself. I found a girl, the kindest, most beautiful girl ever, and I fell in love. But as the title suggests, I messed it up. I fell in love with her, she fell in love with me too, but I had a female friend with whom I was a little too flirtatious. Even though me and my girlfriend (who is also depressed and used to cut herself often and is now on medication) weren't dating at that moment, I had the FUCKING audacity to talk the other girl as if I liked her. That made my girlfriend hurt herself. Me and my girlfriend, we were making out and immediately after that, I described a sex dream about the friend, WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT, I TOLD HER THAT I WOKE UP WITH A BONER???? Even after all this, my girlfriend stayed with me, and then she told me that she wants me to not talk to that friend BUT I SAID NO I WILL NOT STOP TALKING TO HER, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I SAID NO. Then my girlfriend threatened to leave me if I didn't stop to talking to her, and after realising that my sanity was at stake, I told her that I will stop talking to her, BUT HERE'S THE CATCH, I WAS STILL TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND DIDN'T TELL MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT. After she confronted me about it, I finally stopped talking to her, but I guess it was too late. We didn't break-up, but she started bringing up breaking up with me frequently because of the way I treated her, she's right. I then, after realising how bad I fucked up, I started making amends, started trying to redeem myself but to no avail. Today, it has been 8 months since we started dating and one of her puppies died and I told her that I used to hurt myself because when she used to get mad and used to tell she'd rather be with ""A guy she knows"" because he wouldn't hurt her from the beginning, even though I swore never to hurt myself again. And now she doesn't want to be with me and also feels like killing herself because she hurt me, even though it is my fault and I should've told her earlier, she takes the blame on herself and doesn't want to be with me anymore.

I have never been properly diagnosed. Well, I've been to many different people and i have gotten many different diagnosises: major depression, bipolar, schizophrenic. So, i have a lot of confusion within myself with my situation and its quite frustrating. It would be helpful to know whats going on with me so i could deal with what i have going on as best as possible. 

I guess im just ranting because i dont know i how to feel or what to do with anything i have going on. I feel so debilitated. On top of that i take medication, which is another annoying and confusing process within itself (having to figure what works for you and what dose works for you). I take Lamictal 400mg right now, but i dont know if thats too much because i feel like im having some cognitive issues like forgetting what im going to say mid sentence or have nothing to think of in general (very blank), but like i said very confusing because i dont know if its the medication doing that or the condition/mental illness that i deal with. Also, sexual dysfunction is THE WORST... Im 20 so this is a issue for me when it comes to medications. I never know how to feel about what im taking and when it comes to medication i am very impatient and freak out at the beginning when i start to feel all of the intial side effects. When that happens I'll self medicate and switch my dose by myself. I know this wont help anything, but ill have anxiety about it and just make a rash decision.

Sorry about the long post, but i feel like i dont have people that deal with similar issues to talk about this with. I feel like giving up a lot because i just dont know what to do anymore or how to fix myself or at least be a functional person.

Due to some unfortunate traumatic events, I was taught at a very young age that anyone you trust can betray you and ruin your life, but somewhere along the lines, I still adapted a rather selfless personality (That isn't self-flattery). 

I have a serious problem with putting people before myself. Not so much doing favors and sacrificing my own, letting them walk all over me, but I invest all of my time thinking about my friends, partners, and family, alongside all their issues. I'm well aware that their problems aren't mine to take on, but I overthink them regardless. Same applies to my own issues, but it's much worse. Especially with the quarantine, I've been given a large amount of time to sit and think things over and over to the point of unhealthiness.

I've begun distancing myself from people, and usually that'd be a major sign to myself that things are getting bad, but it actually feels like my first step to healing. I am a very socially oriented person, and It's seriously taken a toll on me. Not to mention the fact that most of the people in my life wouldn't even put a fraction of as much thought into me as I do them. 

In an ideal situation, I isolate myself entirely from everyone, and take this time to learn how to focus on myself and bettering who I am. My only problem, however, is that I'm very back-and-forth with things (eg. leaving a partner, claiming it's for mental healing, and then coming back mere days later)  I convince myself that everybody overthinks as much as I do, and i convince myself i want that. I convince myself that I'm happy in whatever situation I'm in, and it always brings me back, no matter how terrible the scenario. 

What I feel like I need is a sign, I feel like I need something to remind me to never truly trust anybody, I need to be reminded that I never really mattered to them, because I don't. I need to push myself away from contact because somewhere through the years, I never learnt to be truest to myself. I need to be told that people leave and people die, and the only constant in my life will ever be me. I need to gain that sense of selfness that I'm sure could better me as a person.

In order to save time I won't go into the details of my personal symptoms. 

However for the last 3-4 months, I've been making quite a big effort to pull myself out of the depression with some success. However from time to time daily I do fall back into my old thought patterns. During this time I usually managed by keeping to myself(for 2-3hrs) and making an effort to keep myself busy through one of my hobbies (I'm 17 and live with my family so talk to them regardless of my mood). Usually my sprinting practice is the most successful at getting me out of the mental state. 

Very recently I began speaking to a counselor (online due to the quarantine circumstances). It hasn't caused much difference yet but I am still hopeful. The counselor recommended that I still reach out to 1 or 2 closer friends during times where I feel like this. This is different to my usual method however I was happy to try it.

**The main issue:**

When choosing someone to talk about it with, I chose a friend who I know had also been through a similar mental struggle and had opened up to me about it. When this happened, I was always happy to talk to him and help him through it. Therefore I assumed it'd be good to talk with him as he'd be able to relate. 

However, when I've tried talking about what I'm going through with him after a few messages he'll just leave my message unopened (for around a day), this is unusual because if we're having a usual conversation he'd reply sooner. After having done this he'll begin a conversation on a completely different topic. Basically ignoring what I said before. The first time this happened I just ignored it thinking that it was probably a coincidence. I spaced out each attempt by a few weeks. However after the 2nd and 3rd time it began to bother me. Especially when I see him posting on his story or group-chats etc.

Therefore, I am wondering if anyone has had something similar happen? and what did they do about it? Should I just communicate what I've noticed and be honest that it's bothering me (this feels quite odd for me to do as I'm usually quite a jokey person and we usually joke around together).",Depression

I spent years like that, trying to work and study and always being fucked over by depression/trauma, and failing to recognize it as such. I thought I was just worthless, unable to work hard because of some internal defect. I remember scouring the DMV thinking I had to have some personality disorder. I became obsessed with introversion and the MBTI because I then thought ""oh I can't do the shit I need to do because I'm an INTP trapped in an extrovert feeler world"". I kept deluding myself by following every failure with an ""it must be because I'm too smart for everything"" pep talk. My life is not a bed of roses now, but at least I acknowledged I needed help for depression and PTSD, and got it. 

Anyway, TL;DR is that I spent over a decade in denial of my trauma and depression.",Depression
Regret of something i did as a teen need advice/help,1,g1uqup,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1uqup/regret_of_something_i_did_as_a_teen_need/,3,1586995213.0,"When I was younger I have faint memories of being abused which caused me to become hyper sexual at a young age. I seemed to have blurred the lines of right and wrong and made excuses for people I cared about.

Sex was not talked about to me ever at all in my family. I was an awkward shy kid full of shame and highly sensitive/insecure. I found porn on a TV I had and porn in my dads room. It haunted me at first and then I got curious and would look at it sometimes. Cut to my teens when puberty hit for me (F)(I was a late bloomer 14/15) and my sexual urges became heightened. I was confused cause noone talked about it with me. Fast forward one day my dog sniffed my private while I was changing and I thought ""i wonder what oral would feel like” cause i saw it in porn and i thought other kids my age were trying it whilst also copying porn. I put something over my underwear for her to lick off and I remember thinking i was only going to do it for a second but it lasted longer. After i felt weird and dirty but brushed it off. About a year later I eventually told my mom bc the guilt was eating me alive. And now it's coming back again years later. I feel paralyzed with guilt and shame. I feel like I destroyed my life. idk how to move on. Is there a way? I feel so alone but also deserving. I'd never physically hurt a person or animal and it makes me feel like shit that I thought that was ok at the time.  I've prayed to god for forgiveness every time I think about it and will be for the rest of my life but I don't feel forgiven bc I can't seem to forgive myself. Quite frankly it makes me feel like i was like an abuser/predator and my mind connects with awful criminal type people. I want to feel like a good person again but my thoughts want me to punish myself but i can't bc i love my family and they hate seeing me in bed 247.

I don't know...

I don't know. Sometimes I know and other times I'm not really sure. Is this whole thing just fake? Did my brain create this story for me to believe so that I can feel some sense of certainty, or that I can feel that I'm 'special' and people should pity me? Do I cut only so I can think ""only someone with depression would hurt themselves on purpose, right? So I must have depression, right? Right?"". is it lying to me, like everyone says it does? Sometimes I'm happy, briefly, and then it reminds me of everything and my smile fades. No one notices, though. But those were genuine smiles. So I can't have depression if im smiling, right? If I felt happiness? Oh, someone did notice. They asked me if I was sad, and trapped and scared in the moment, I said ""no one will ever know..?"" stupid. Fucking stupid. I didn't want to lie but I couldn't say the truth. I'm such an idiot. That's literally such a stupid thing to say. And then my dad noticed. Trapped me in my room and asked if I was OK. I said ""yeah, I'm fine, I'm always like this."" so stupid. But I didn't know if I have depression, so what if it turned out that I didn't and people laughed at me and judged me and called me a crybaby and a wimp behind my back? I'm only 13, so I have nothing to worry about right? Nothing to be sad about? It would destroy me. Because it's true. And that's what hurts. I don't know who I am, what I'm supposed to do. Just school, and feeling nothing. Wake up, stress. Go to bed, emptyness. No emotion. Just stress. Brief happiness. Sadness. Self-hatred. The feeling of being lost. I want to cry but if I do people will hear me. Fuck. I'm a wimp. A loser. No one actually likes me, how could they? WHY would they? So many questions. No answer. I'll never get answers. It'll constantly be this feeling of being trapped. A cycle. No motivation, but I have to act OK, otherwise they'll give me that piteous look and ask me questions I don't want to answer. Because if I don't have depression, they'll hate me and say I just want attention. They'll hate me more than they already do. But I laugh, so I'm okay. Right?

The results were abysmal - I got rejected from 6 out of the 8 universities which I applied to, had to rescind one offer because I couldn't supply my finances in time and got accepted into one. I've had no luck on the scholarship front either. 

I've not been taking this news well at all. I was really harbouring great dreams to go to the US to study music, and it feels like my dreams have all been smashed. I genuinely thought I had a chance of getting in to the schools I wanted, but now it feels like reality has delivered the verdict, and the truth of it is I simply haven't accomplished as much with my life as I thought I did. It feels like all I've done has amounted to nothing. 

A good majority of my close friends did manage to get into reputable overseas universities, and I can't help feeling left out and utterly inferior to them. I can't socialise with other people now without constantly being reminded of my own inability to achieve things. They say that to be successful you ought to surround yourself with successful people to learn from them, but all I feel is inadequacy. 

I've also felt that my learning capabilities have become compromised. Now I feel either cynical, impatient or resigned while learning. I have no mood to learn new things and I can't help getting a feeling of, ""my time has passed, I should have done all these things during childhood,"" when picking up new skills. I get really impatient now and constantly expect quick results, which usually don't happen and end up making me even more frustrated. 

I've had depressive episodes before, but last year was really a hopeful and inspiring one because I was stepping out of my comfort zone and I was really trying to take life in new directions I hadn't gone to before. 2020 is turning out to be the antithesis of that - getting rejected feels like all I'm doing has come to naught and everything I've tried to build has been a lie. I'm sinking into a slump where every day just passes by in a blur and I don't know how to shake it off. 

This is just a bad year all-round. I'm aware that all of this has sounded like self-absorbed narcissistic whining, but I wanted to get it off my chest regardless. Thanks everyone if you've read this far, and I hope that all of you are coping well with the coronavirus quarantine yourselves.",Depression

I just did both the worst and best thing I have done in a long time. 10 months ago I met a girl. I uave never had a better relationship with anyone ever. We never dated, we were just good friends. However, I did develop feelings for her, in fact, she is the first person I've ever been in love with. I had a girlfriend when we met. I decided to dump her to be with this girl. I never shoot my shot because I was too scared to do so and, well, we never became anything more than good friends. 5 months ago she started dating someone. Every other night I've been crying myself to sleep since then. I never stop thinking about her and I tried my best so we wouldn't drift off and stay as friends. Nothing I did worked, and we ended up hardly ever talking, only when she felt like shit. I tried to kill myself again month ago and she called me up. I told her how I felt and she pretty much told me to stop being a dumbass. Today I told her that it would be better if we never talked again, and even after being taken off my meds by my psychiatrist and not needing therapy anymore due to being well, I have not felt this shit in months, yet I know this is better for me

The past 2 years have been hell.  I started into a downward spiral that i couldn't control.  I took an attempt on my life and was hospitalized.  
After starting meds again it took almost a year to get on the upswing again but the side effects took a toll on me. I stayed on the meds until i had a good grasp on my sanity again and went off of them feeling happy. (September)

Now I've never really wanted to have kids (I'm child free) and within weeks of being off of medication I got pregnant at 38. (October). 

I still didn't want to have a child into this mess of my life.  I had an abortion as soon as i could. Because I got it so quickly, i wasn't able to speak to the doctor between having my ultrasound (to confirm how far i was into pregnancy) and the procedure day.  On the day of the procedure (November) i found out i had another large cyst on my ovary. I have had them surgically removed years ago, multiple times.  The cyst was too large to ignore it and the procedure i was having wasn't going to fix it. I had to schedule another surgery appointment for the new year.  

Had the cyst removed and got my tubes tied. (January). The recovery from surgery was 4-6 weeks.  I don't heal quickly so it took me about 8 weeks to feel fully healed.  During my recovery i thought it would be good for me to take a trip.  I love to travel and hadn't done any big trips in 3 years.  Traveling far away from my problems is an empowering thing for me so i booked a trip through Italy (February). 

 I was to leave on March 4th. I got a common flu days before i was to depart anyway so I'm glad i didn't go now as my flight home from Milan was cancelled. (March) The world went into lockdown mode, everyone has to stay home.  I need to get away.  

I find some reprieve when i go to work (gas/oil sector) so i guess that's a plus.  I'm still working my usual shifts (days and nights). i can't help but feel that  everything is working against my getting fully well again.  

I'm struggling right now.  I would normally just write all of this in my journal but i can't seem to find it.  I had an anxiety attack when i couldn't find it so i posted here.

Am I just self diagnosing?,1,g1qh4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1qh4v/am_i_just_self_diagnosing/,0,1586980372.0,"Hello.

I've noticed a lot of differences between 15 year old me & 19 year old me. I know as we grow up our perceptions, views & thoughts also tend to change, but I don't think mine falls into that category of 'change'.

 When I was younger, I was very ambitious, confident, determined & I knew what I wanted. Now, it's the exact opposite. I don't want to do anything, I don't have any interests and I can't help but think how meaningless life is & how much I hate being the person I am. I just feel like I don't deserve the life I have, it's too good for someone like me to live it. I always feel like a burden to people & I feel like everyone hates me (not that anyone ever said anything). I feel like they just treat me well because they're stuck with me & there's nothing they can do about it.


My brother had studied psychiatry & he was the one whom I could talk to openly. However, he told me not to label myself under those big words. So I have stopped talking to him about it.


 A day won't pass without thinking about death & how everything would've been better if I had never existed. I used to beat myself up, but I have stopped cause my body is now used to the pain. Also, I can't feel sympathy nor empathy anymore. I don't miss anyone, I don't love any one, the only emotions I feel are anger & disappointment. So it's hard for me to connect with people & I'm very isolated, like I get introvertion but mine has passed the line, I couldn't even attend my brother's wedding cause I was afraid to do something stupid & embarrass him & afraid of people judging me. On top of that, whenever I feel a tiny bit happy I feel guilty cause I feel like a loser like me doesn't deserve to be happy. 


So please let me know if there's something wrong with me or I'm fine & just making this up. Cause I genuinely can't tell if this is really happening to me or it's all in my head. Is this normal or I'm just overreacting?",Depression

Finding me!",1,g1qgqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1qgqn/warning_novel_of_doom_ahead_finding_me/,2,1586980324.0,"Since birth i was given away, the only girl to my mother. She kept my brothers. I was raised with different types of people, family, to strangers & even friends. It was horrible! My upbringing was AWFUL, mentally, emotionally, sexual abuse, abused.  Nobody loved me. I ended up with my 1st child @ the age of 16. I didn't know what I was doing, thought I was in love forever, til he cheated on me when our son was 3 months old! I threw him out of my life & moved on to an unstable mother & found another guy to love, I gave birth to our daughter. Her father was crazy, abused me most times well pregnant, ran away from him with my kids @ the age of 17. His family took me to court for my son & our daughter, they spoke lies about me, they wanted me to stay with the crazy son. They found me & my kids were ripped away like a lit match stick! I'm more lost than anything at this point, I'm trying to do right for me but everytime I failed because I didnt care no more. Drinking & smoking weed made me happy, help drown out the pain! 2yrs later I'm 19yrs old, I met a guy who's 16yrs old. I couldn't help but make myself known to his presence @ a course we both attended. We eventually made out & stuck together for 10yrs & in that 10yrs we had 5 kids. My life had changed dramatically from LOST to settled, I gave birth to his 1st child but my 3rd. After hrs in labour, we had him for 30mins till his passing, the most difficult part of my life. Losing a child in my opinion is worse than the abuse & rape I've had to endure. A week after his passing, the father had gone back to work, he didnt cry or realize he had gone. 1st day @ work he was hospitalized, fell from a 2 story building shattering his right arm. After all of this, he started to abuse me so bad, I still stayed with him & gave birth to the rest of his 5. He was in & out of jail constantly for abuse, I was having to deal with Child Youth & Families until 1 day they we're uplifted because I let him back into our lives knowing he was abusive & a high risk to almost killing me so many times. I put my kids at risk, even with drinking around them. I've never known what LOVE or how to trust the person you love. I'm very hidden with how I can start something out of nothing, the jealousy towards another female or anyone getting close to the one I love is A NO. My upbringing I blame for that. After them been uplifted in 2014, I'm definitely drowning in SHIT, don't care for nothing or myself. He ends up in jail a few months later, 2yrs he's doing. I'm on the outside waiting for him like a dumb cunt, in 2016 I found someone on facebook. Wasnt looking for love, he was someone that attended the same school as me back when I was 13. We end up talking little bits, he started to get at me on a daily its unbelievable how I'm here 5yrs later with him lol. He's born on the same day as the one in jail, in different years. We're also 3 days apart on our birthdays. He came across as a narcissist, It was unbelievably difficult for me. I found so much connection to this guy, I couldn't let go. He was not my type but the bond was strong. He has a daughter, I've never been in a relationship with a guy who had a child, so it took a toll on me to accept it. The fact I had to make room for someone that he showed a huge amount of love for, made me feel jealous. After spending time with her, I started to accept her more, I actually loved been there for her because I didnt have any of my own kids with me. She gave me hope to motivate myself to see my kids. 3yrs into our relationship we had a son my 8th child! His daughter went to live with her mother, it's best she did, she was depressed with us. I couldn't be that mother figure to her cos she loved her own mother. Today is the 15th of April 2020, my eldest boy will be 18 this month. My 8th child has autism, I'm still with his father. I'm 34 turning 35 in August this year, I'm heavily depressed, never spoke to anyone about my troubled life. Drunk it away, laughed it off & forgave so many that did me wrong. I suffer from anxiety attacks, I feel as if I'm slowly dying. I'm too young to die & I have so many things I want to do as a individual women, I'm highly motivated but I know my partner will feel insecure about me wanting to get out there on social media. I gave up smoking in October 2019, never have I quit smoking before thanks to my major ANXIETY ATTACK! I've also cut back on drinking, thanks to my trip to the hospital with a liver issue. Now I'm plain, with so many things I want to do. I have low self esteem due to weight gain, my confidence has stepped up to 60% my inside though feels tired, for years I lost my purpose & myself. These last few months I've been searching for me, I've found bits & pieces. I don't want to waste anymore of my life doing what others want of me or giving others what I think they want! I get to see all my children (heart is relieved) reducing stress. Lazy, which is a good thing, I suffered & still suffer from OCD. I have major health issues but tests say I'm healthy. It could be my mind overthinking. I'm praying someone or anyone could talk to me & tell me it's ok. I often think of the homeless & all those suffering in other countries that are asking for miracles. If I had any kind of high power, I'd definitely do my best to save as many as I can. Its who I am as a person, caring for others even if they committed a crime I can't hate. I pretend to be tough out there but hurting any living thing breaks my heart. I hate that I can't hate the people who raped me, it makes me hate myself so much. I'm a follower but I know deep down i can be a good leader, if I found who I am. Thanks for letting me share my NOVEL of doom. Never shared a briefing of my life before with strangers! Oh well I feel it may help since I couldn't speak to a counselor due to my anxiety attacks.",Depression

Depression. It’s a bitch. 
It took me to the brink of life and death in 8th grade and now again when I’m 21 years old. It wasn’t supposed to be like this and I felt disappointed in myself for so long for not being able to “fix myself”. For those who have reached out to me, thank you. You may think that saying hi was insignificant, but your notification was literally the only light in my room sometimes. And those who didn’t, how could you have known. I’ve always been ashamed of my depression. I’ve always tried to hide it behind smiles and jokes. It made me feel better momentarily. But I always ended up feeling alone because I had no one that knew the real me. And I’m tired of that. It took a lot of courage saying this, and even more courage to get help. But thanks to the wonderful people supporting me I’m able to stand strong. Starting today, I’m going to be living fully and un-apologetically me. It took me a long way to get here...

I've been trying hard for years to think more positively, like instead of saying ""I want to die"" I'll try to say ""I don't want to die, I just want to stop hurting."" But when the bitch starts saying horrrible things, like ""You're such a terrible person"" I can't say ""no, I'm not a bad person"" because that's exactly what I'd say if I was a bad person. A  bad person would deliberately play up their suffering to make themselves look like an innocent victim so they could do no wrong. What if that's what I'm doing but I'm so good that I even fooled myself to I think I deserve saving? What if I've subconsciously tricked myself into thinking I'm innocent? I can't tell. I don't think I could ever be able to tell.

 For all I know, the bitch in my head is right about everything and I ought to just kill myself to save everyone else from me. But then again thinking I matter enough at all for people to be afraid of me is so arrogant. Who do I think I am? Why would anyone notice me, good or bad?

I always knew school was having a very bad effect on my mental health, but never put anymore emphasis on it than other things that cause me stress and depression like relationships, the state of the world, etc...

In the last 2 years of school I have changed.  made many friends, had fun with them.  Everything was the same in the first year and a half of the university.  Then bad things happened in my life.  I got depressed.  (I have a confirmed diagnosis).  For about a year I did not go anywhere except study and shop, rarely went for a walk.  I stopped seeing all my friends in real life.  Over the past half year I went to the party 3 times.  I forced myself to go there because I thought it would help me.  During this time, I began to feel worse every day.  It seems to me that people are looking at me because something is wrong with my face.  Every time I meet a girl I like, thoughts arise in my head that I am a jerk, and should not even think about her.  My mind makes me think that I am not worthy to be part of someone's life.

But the worst thing is that for a long time, I think about suicide every day.  These thoughts arise completely suddenly.  Sometimes it’s enough for me to look at my face in the mirror, and my brain begins to think that such a freak as I am not worthy to even appear in public, and it is better for him to kill himself.  I am very much afraid, because every day these thoughts arise more often, and they are more and more detailed.  The only thing that keeps me here is my relatives.  I'm afraid to go completely crazy.  Now I am very lonely, I have not seen friends for many weeks.  All I dream about is a normal life, like everyone else.

  We were outside, sitting around a small table in our front of the house. Just enjoying the day with some coffee and tea(me lol). I already had made up my mind to tell her about it. I was shaking. I wrote down what I felt that day(July 4, 2019). This is what I wrote:
 
"" I told my grandma that I liked girls. And now I can't stop crying for what she told me.. I have a major headache for holding back my screams.. or probably because I started hitting my head on the floor.
I feel like leaving because there is just no way of undoing this. Why did I say that? I was having a lovely morning and I opened my big stupid mouth! I don't feel like getting out of my room for anything.. I haven't had breakfast either.. shit. 
I just have got to calm down.. but I can't! When I think I finally stopped crying, I think of what happened and more tears keep reappearing.. kill me please.""
  
  I told her that she'd be disappointed and would throw me out. She was disappointed and said that she wouldn't throw me out. She was just a bit upset that she wouldn't be able to keep the promise she kept to my mom(Rest in Peace) of making sure I was a good Christian kid to be able to get into Heaven and see her again. I was crying in front of her. She didn't yell, but I could hear the disappointment in her voice.

Then when coronavirus started to get serious it was like all of my progress and hope was completely undone. I'm a very social person, my depression comes from having a lot of anxiety and general hopelessness when things look grim, but I've always felt happiest when having support/living life. Now I'm faced every day with staring at my childhood room, reading reports that this is gonna go on for 2 years. I only have a limited time to be young and honestly I can barely bear the thought of another month of this, let alone years or this becoming the new normal. I have never had this consistent thoughts of suicide even if this isn't the most depressed I've ever been. It just has never seemed this hopeless. If it looked like things would be normal even in a month or so, I think I have learned enough coping skills to manage. But this is the first time in my life where the more I see that the end date is not for months or years, the more I question how I'm going to stay sane or alive to see it. I'd rather die of the virus than rot like this.

 ""Why do we cut? Is it because we're depressed? It it because we try to show people that their words don't hurt as much as the blade? Or do we just want to feel something? Whatever the reason is; we (not all) feel the need to be asked.
  We don't like it when you found out that from someone else. We want to tell you what goes through our mysterious minds. Is a bit difficult when you're yelling though.. you aren't the ""police"" trying to make us tell you some type of information. If you could just CALMY ask us. Screaming will just make us want to keep all our feelings out of your sight so that you won't yell.
  We understand that you are worried or desperate to know,but we won't tell you willingly if you don't want to listen willingly. Please try understand.. we feel like no one could ever care if we die,disappear,or have problems in our lifes. You probably never went through what we went through. We can feel that you are upset or disappointed at us, but please.. don't give up on us.
  We might keep doing it until we are as empty as an egg shell. Not only do we cut,but we try to get rid of pain in many ways. Some do drugs,vape,drink,or are just darn mean. Some cut,bite,try to suffocate, drown,hang,or cry. We are people; and just like animals:not all of us are bad.
  When I get upset at someone,I do many different things. I get out of there,I break something,bite, or just cry for how much I feel like hurting them. While am typing this.. I cutted my arm.. a little too dip than usual. My arm feels tingly, numb,and I feel an urge to taste my blood. Wierd?
  When people make me feel depressed, I have a sick pain in my stomach that makes me feel like throwing up or punching my stomach. I just read that when you cut yourself; your life spam(or something like that) decreases by 6%. I must be close to dying then :')... I have many friends that do the same,that feel like they can't keep on going. Some friends that I left behind because of moving.

My depression has never made me think about suicide, not even for a fraction of a second. I just never have thought about it.

My depression is simply lack of literally all energy. I wake up, and lay in bed for a solid 3 hours (on a good day). I think nothing happy, and just feel absolutely no happiness or urgency to do anything. 

Over the past year, since being in grad school, my depression has most definitely gotten worse. I don’t want to get up. No amount of caffeine can help me accomplish anything. I truly just do NOT have energy in me.

I have tried everything to bring positive change in my life. After the 3 hours of doing Fuck all, I drag myself to the gym 5-6 days a week. I am able to eat healthy. I’ve managed to get quite muscular, while at the same time being horribly depressed with no desire to pursue friendships or relationships. I go on long walks, I run and other forms of cardio.

There is only so much exercise and self care I can do. It keeps me from falling into a true pit of despair I believe, but it certainly doesn’t cure my depression in the slightest.

I’ve now started to think trying anti depressants may be for me. I had my testosterone tested. Twice. It’s completely normal. So I know it isn’t lack of that hormone, which I had suspected before to due lack of libido.

Does this sound like a case which would see a positive change by trying anti depressants? Can I at least try it, come off if I don’t like it? I honestly don’t know what else to do at this point.

I hate School,1,g1o3un,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1o3un/i_hate_school/,4,1586968733.0,"I hate school

So I randomly started thinking about when I was in Year 7 ( In UK, currently Year 10). But anyway I have low functioning autism which sucks incredibly( I’ll get onto that later), so I had been at this pretty good school that worked you pretty hard and the week before half term I was basically just talking with my new friend of about 2 months, and we were just joking around on the bus when I lightly slapped him on the face, anyway I thought nothing of it and we continued talking until we got to school. When we got there though a Year 12 I think came up to me and said why did you hit ____, which I was confused by and basically just went to class. Later in the second class of the day the lower school headmaster( or whatever weird title he had) came in and took me out of class, and I was completely confused, but he said that _____ had gone to the nurses with a red mark on his face( he wasn’t in my class btw) which I knew was total bullshit as I hardly touched his face but then as I have low functioning autism it basically means I lose complete function over my body and I said I wanted to kill myself and the teacher was complete shit at handling it.

Fast forward a few months and I basically developed anger management, depression, etc. and I was still at the school getting in for about 2 hours a week and feeling like utter crap. 

Then just before the first Christmas of Year 7 and I moved to another school which was honestly great, I mean I had loads of friends (actually good friends this time) and I was seeing a counsellor at the school and I felt slightly better about myself. Then after two months the counsellor, who was fully confidential, literally reported my dad to the local council as he was mentally abusive to me and I needed to tell someone so I told them, so thanks to that shit show I lost all confidence in that school and moved on.

I then had a few day trials at schools and did a month on an online school which was terrible.

Then in the Easter term of Year 8 I went to another school, for a term long trial, and I enjoyed that again and it was ok apart from the end of term when it felt like no one cared about me and I basically just walked out one day ( because I wanted to go home so I went to the office were they were supposed to call my mum, they refused and so for pretty much 2 hours I sat on the sofa by the office until I just couldn’t be fucked and left) then on that same my mum went for a meeting and the school said they wouldn’t take me back next year and I cried and was incredibly depressed for about a week.

I’ve now found a tiny collage with 6 people in a class that’s literally meant for me as I was the first student there, and while it has its ups and downs it pretty good and I’ve actually been at one school for almost two years.

Honestly though just thinking about how one person saying that I punched them has basically ruined 3 years of my life and possibly will affect my adult life, it just makes me annoyed and depressed which is why I felt I had to get it out of my system.

It definitely reminds me of my childhood where I had very limited friends since I was sort of this emo nerd who got along with everyone but was never really kept around, no matter how hard I tried. I've had contact with a few of my close friends, but I've been wanting more than the sporadic texts or the very rare phone call. I've been sort of falling into the routine of getting up, writing or drawing, cleaning, reading, studying just for the hell of it, and exercising. My dogs passed away last year, and they were the only reasons why I felt anything and the only reasons why I stayed home after college.

I can't ask my family for support since they keep telling me ""millions of people are going through the same thing"". But are those millions of people suffering related to them? No. I get it, people have it worse, but I'm allowed to feel the way I feel. I had a lot of time to research my own psyche and why I am the way I am, and it sucks really bad. I miss working so I can distract myself from those thoughts, and the thoughts of returning home feeling like I'm not good enough. Feeling like I'm a failure for being 25 and not being financially stable enough to make rent in Hawaii, where it costs a fucking kidney and liver to rent a shitty ass apartment and have a car, even with another person. I help out as much as I can at home, but it never feels like enough. I thought I was going somewhere with my life. I had huge plans.

This is the first time in a very long time I've let my feelings out since I always felt like I was being a baby when I did. As long as I can remember, I've kept my feelings to myself because when I was a kid it was always ""Don't get upset."", ""Why are you getting mad for?"", ""There's no reason to be depressed, it's all in your head."", ""You can't hang out with these decent kids you like because I don't know or like them."" So as a result, instead of being resilient like I thought I was throughout high school and college, it turns out I've just become an overly-critical, avoidant, closed-off asshole who kept her nose in books instead of trying to make meaningful relationships. I'm still trying to work out how to maintain friendships, maintain a relationship, and not distance myself the moment I get too close to anyone. I think I might be so closed off that even words can't help me at this point. Yet, I still miss people.

My family is not poor but we're not doing that great either. But due to being in med school I'm being exposed to a lot of flexing (both intended and unintended) from my classmates. This is mostly because a lot of the students here have medic parents, and are therefore pretty rich. Cool cars, newest phone, expensive PCs, expensive clothes.

Now I don't really care about phones and clothes, but seeing them drive cool cars and play the newest games hurts me deeply, as both of those are big passions of mine. I love cars but my parents can't afford to buy me one, and med school doesn't leave me time to get a job. I also love gaming but all I have is a crappy laptop and I can't afford a better one right now either.

Some dudes my age drive million dollar cars and have the most expensive shit, and I can't help but hate this life for being so unfair and wondering why I wasn't born rich too. And nobody seems to ever think about how quite a lot of people have it so much better, instead focusing on the people that have it worse. And that whole ""Money does not buy happiness"" is just a tactic for rich people to keep us simpletons from rioting against their evil thiefy asses and settle for the leftovers.

This also brings me to another issue: I hate rich people with all my broke-ass heart. I have rich friends and they are nice, but it seems like most rich people are complete assholes. And it irks me how some dudes flex their wealth even though their parents are rich, not themselves. But still, their life is a lot easier and more fun. And I hate them because of my envy. This poisons my soul and makes me a bitter person.

Again, I would love to work and buy the stuff I want, but I really don't have time for a job. Med shool is quite hard, and not even the quarantine makes it any better since I still wake up early, still study, still partake in classes and lectures (online) and still have assignments. I don't know what job I could possibly sneak into my schedule since I have like 2 free hours daily. And this is not bullshit, I'm down to try anything if you have suggestions.

Every day, from when I wake up until I go to sleep, I hate my life for being so mediocre and unfair. Please help me stop being so materialistic. I'm sure there are lots of wise people here that could guide me and save my soul. This thing is ruining me, it's really bad. It clouds my judgement and makes me hateful. But no matter how hard I try, I always come back to my mindset of ""Why should I bother working my ass off just to MAYBE have a fraction of what other people lucked into at birth? Why play the rigged game? Life is unfair and I shouldn't bother since I was unlucky at birth""

Please help me get rid of this mentality. I know I'm a hateful piece of shit that doesn't appreciate what he has, but I want to change this.",Depression

I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I'll feel fine for a good while, and then it'll hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I couldn't even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I'm simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know if I'm ever going to return to college. I'm still in debt for this class too. I'm living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan. I'm grateful to have it. I don't know what kind of life awaits me. I'm 23, and time just seems to zoom by. I don't know if I can handle a job. I'm very socially anxious, very self concious and self hating, and when the depressive episode hits, I'm 100% useless for an extended period of time. I'm good at art... drawing, writing... I'm even working on game design. I wrote a novella late last year and sold it on amazon but didn't make much, I didn't have much for marketing. I guess I'm just going to persue a commission based income with art and other creative things I could possibly come up with... Etsy maybe? I don't know... All I know is that I feel sad, and disappointed. Guilty as well. Always very guilty. But I did learn that the traditional route of college, and standard job just isn't going to work for me.

In all honesty, I would have taken a long walk off a short pier years ago if it weren’t for my family.  There’s just something so uplifting about having 6-7 members of your family tell you (at different times) they don’t want you to kill yourself because it would make them sad.  I’m sure they thought they were helping in their own inept way but really, all it did was drive home the fact that my whole life i’ve been an utter failure and all i’ve ever really done is hurt and disappoint my family.

In law school. Life sucks. Quality of life is on the decline. Compared to past generationts we are producing more and more wealth for our corporate overlords while quality of life continues to fall. Bad enough. Due to COVID, I am now unemployed this summer and had to move back in with my parents. Hate it. Compeltely feels like everything I ever worked for is pointless. That I am back at square one.

Live in Canada but of South Asian Muslim background. South Asian Muslim culture is f*cked up. Teens and young adults are infantilized. Really not good for one's self-esteem and sense of self worth. I was a devout Muslim in my teens. Left the faith about 4 years ago. I believe in creator and I do believe in certain religious values but I do not believe in Islam or in any particular religion. Honestly, I abhor Islam. The God of Islam is harsh and cruel and has ridiculous demands. Full rigidity. No Flexibility. Like starting in 10 days I have to spend a month starving and dehydrating myself to appease a psychotic God who will severely punish me if I don't. It spikes my depression. And since I am unemployed at stuck at home, I really have to sneak to cheat. And I feel bad doing it when my family is fasting. My dad is really religious and I have a super religious grandma (typical stereotype) so religion is a dominant topic in the house. I also have objections to its truth claims, I just in good conscience cannot accept Muhammed as an infallible final prophet and a source of moral authority

I have never really had it great. Never really had friends growing up outside of a couple family friends. Didn't really make friends till undergrad, and the first group of friends I made turned out to be sociopaths out to get me. I have some friends now. I am also close to my little cousins but they live abroad so I cannot really be in contact with them. Of course, my extended family are all mostly practicing Muslims as well so I cannot really have an honest relationship w/ them and I worry about the future. Either I have to pretend to be a Muslim, end up in a loveless arranged marriage, and keep familial ties. Or I officially leave the faith and destroy my family.

In my 4th year of undergrad (2017-2018) I fell in love with someone who was everything I ever wanted in a partner. Successful, moral, life-partner type, virign, great with kids (all of which I bring to the table). Everything I was looking for. She also was, as a bonus, from a well-of finally and beautiful. She was what it seemed to be a true happily ever after. I had suffered a lot and worked hard in life. My family isn't poor (though we were that when we were younger) but we are not rich. My undergrad college though was full of rich, white private school kids. I put in a lot of effort to get where I am at (my resume is stellar and I had to overcome a lot of barriers to get there). The idea that my effort paid of and I could marry a rich white private school girl was a dream come true. She and I got along very well. She was kind hearted. I really thought I had found my match. But for whatever reason, she rejected me. My entirety of everything I worked so hard toward my whole life for - my happily ever after (and yes I know no marriage is truly like that) taken away from me.
I have not been able to find anyone like her. And even worse, because I am male, I have been attacked instead of given sympathy. The dating system is rigged against men. Men are systematically oppressed by women into making the first move. Into taking the emotional burden. Into being and acting a certain way and catering to women's views. Women claim to believe in equality but sure don't act it, by holding men to traditional gender roles while they themselves have been freed from it. Men are still statistically seen as ATMs and providers. And this has bene shown from what people have told me. People have attacked me for wanting a fair deal. That because I am a man I have to be open to marrying down. That despite all the barriers I overcame, I have to be open to marrying someone who has it easier and didn't accomplish as much, ruining all the effort I made in life. That because of my gender, it is my fault she rejected me because I didn't ""ask her out correctly"" or whatever BS hoops men are expected to jump through. (I don't see how it should make a difference but apparently it does. Must be nice being a privelged woman). As a man, I am told that I must just accept a woman who slept around and then wants to settle later in life. Doesn't matter that I come in with purity and certain values. That I have to accept nonense. She didn't go down 2 steps to be with me, and her things were based on privilege of birth, not effort or morals. But I am expected to go down 20 steps to be with whomever

She also was a Catholic. So when I fell for her I started looking into the faith and I found a different kind of God. A loving God. I was so close to converting. If I actually married her, I would have converted. But I do not think the faith is true either. Sure I like things about it, but if it were true God would have given me way in, I.e. that woman's love. Again I thought I found happiness but it was taken away from me. 

I just want someone who loves me unconditionally for whom I am. My parents don't due to faith. So unlike most of the world, I don't have that. I don't have true love. Which is why I can never be happy. And it seems that men do not get true love. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. That men do get valued beyond being resources for women, but it doesn't seem like that.

I would love to be a rich western culture woman. Get the best of everything. I encountered many of them at undergrad, living the dream life. It would be great to have parents accept you for who you are. It would be great to have financial oppurnity. To have tons of self-esteem boosts from suitors. To have true love and relationship dynamics rigged in your favour. I love kids, if I was a woman I could get either get a one night stand (though that kind of behavior is not my thing) or go to a sperm bank and get a kid. As a man, I must commit to a woman and hope she doesn't divorce and take the kids. More stress, less options

I really hate who I am. I wish I were a rich western woman. Living that happy life. Instead I am cursed. Never fully accepted by my family. Raised in a f*cked up religion / culture. Oppressed via society due to my gender. Never get true love and be loved unconditionally for who I am. Quite likely never get kids. Never get happiness. And will just suffer, working as a corporate slave till I die.

but now i fucking swear my depression is totally in charge of me and i can’t regain that control. it doesn’t just make me cry and mope, it completely changed the way i think. i lost my level-headedness that i was always so proud of. my depression keeps me up until 5 am and wakes me up at 8. i’m so tired that i have to drink tons of coffee but i can’t eat a bite of anything without feeling immediately nauseated. so all that’s in my system is caffeine, all day, every day. always jittery and anxious and in cold sweats. i feel like i’m some form of walking depression.

i never thought i’d understand how some people could be moved to suicide. i know i have things and people to live for. i know i have people who love me and who’d be devastated if i really did it. i always felt a little anger for people who so readily expressed their desire to die because i know it costs so much for the loved ones of suicide victims. 

but like i said, depression controls you. it makes me think differently about suicide. yes, i would devastate my loved ones by killing myself. but, as insensitive as this sounds, i wouldn’t feel the guilt of hurting them. i’d be dead. besides, they’d overcome it. they would mourn me, miss me, some longer than others, but it wouldn’t kill them. they would learn to be strong and they would finally take me seriously enough learn from my mistakes. i know i have a lot of life ahead of me right now. but do i? “it gets better.” says who? who’s to say it doesn’t get worse? every time i’ve been in a low place, it gets “better” just long enough that i let my guard down. then it gets bad again, seemingly worse each time. i reassure myself sometimes by picturing myself happy, with a family and tons of kids. that’s my dream. but why should i believe that will happen? i can’t make someone fall in love with me. not everyone finds love, and that’s just a fact.

However, yesterday I also weighed myself. I was kind of curious as to what my weight was, because honestly I felt like I had gained weight more than anything with all the junk I had been eating the rare times I did eat. I had lost weight, and I weighed myself again today after not eating anything and I weighed 2 pounds less than yesterday (I know it's not actual weight, just not having any water in my body). I only weigh myself when I want to lose weight (which, considering I'm already underweight isn't a very good thing). It starts small, unconsciously weighing myself and then next thing you know I'm googling the quickest way to lose weight or browsing on pro-ana Tumblr pages.

&#x200B;

It is currently 9:30 PM, my mom called me into her room to ask whether I was going to make me something to eat. I have not eaten all day, so you would think she'd be happy with me eating something... A week ago I recall her saying ""Well, at least you're eating"" when I told her about the sliders I made. I was NOT making something to eat, all I did was take some fries (LITERALLY only 5 of them) made earlier today by someone in the house out of the fridge. I didn't even bother to heat up the fries because she'd hear the microwave and get pissed off. Whenever I eat at night (for me, 8-10 is a normal time for me to eat), she tells me I'm going to get ""big and fat"" for eating at night. She thinks anything after 5 is too late to eat. I know I'm not going to, and I know Im not fat, but her words are like a little fucking depression cloud where you know it's not true but for some reason you still feel bad. I had eaten one fry before she had talked to me. After she talked to me, I went back into my room, was about to eat another fry, and then stopped myself and just cried. I don't even know why. I just cried.

&#x200B;

She's been doing this since I was a child and I'm so fucking sick of it. I remember being 7 and waking up to make a PB&J sandwich (I've been underweight and struggling to eat my whole life)... It was maybe 11 PM, and she told me I'd get fat for eating at night. It was a PB&J sandwich and I was 7, who says that to a kid? Do you know how much I weighed when I was 7? Less than 40 pounds. A normal 5 year old weighs 40 pounds and I didn't even hit 40 until I was 10 and well into my first year of puberty. I'm so tired of her projecting her insecurities on me. She's overweight, not me. She'd rather have me go a day without eating than to eat at 9 PM and that's fucking insane.

&#x200B;

I want to get up and go eat, just to spite her. But I feel too bad and insecure to do so. I want to eat the 4 fries still sitting next to me, but I cry any time I even think about it. I had a little impulse to go download Tumblr again and browse the pro-ana shit a few minutes ago. Usually I don't think about what or if I'm going to eat the next day or not, I don't plan it. But I genuinely don't even know if I'm going to want to eat tomorrow either. Part of me wants to start intentionally not eating again. I know it's bad, but I just can't get the thoughts out of my head.",Depression
Anyone else wish they could catch Covid-19 and die from it?,3,g1gqz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1gqz1/anyone_else_wish_they_could_catch_covid19_and_die/,0,1586936890.0,"I've  been thinking about committing suicide for a long time. The one thing  that's always stopped me from taking a kitchen knife and slicing myself  open, and watching the blood spurt out like a *Kill Bill* film, is knowing what people would think of me. My family and friends would know I couldn't hack it and was a disappointment.

But now, Covid-19 has come on the scene.

Dying  from coronavirus is a blameless death. No-one can call you a failure  for catching it, it's a virus that strikes the poor and rich, the Tom  Hanks and the Baldricks of the world alike. And compared to suicide, the  loneliest of deaths, dying from Covid-19 is a merciful, beautiful  death.

Compare with dying because I  deliberately overdosed on my antidepressants: and being found four  weeks later by the custodian crowbarring my door open because the  neighbours complained of a mysterious overpowering stench caused by my  badly decomposing corpse (the place where I lay leaving a dark stain on  the carpet that no amount of scrubbing can remove, and which the tenants  that moved in after me do their best to try to ignore).

Meanwhile,  with Covid-19, I'd be surrounded by doting doctors and nurses fussing  over me, applying balms and soothing salves to my skin. My mother and  father would Zoom in to cry over me and call me a poor thing as I drew  my last breaths on a ventilator, and ascend to heaven under the angelic,  white light of fluorescent hospital filaments.

Where  I live, New Zealand, is one of the few states not majorly affected by  coronavirus (we have 9 deaths so far). With so few deaths, each person  that passes away gets a full spread on the newspapers and wall-to-wall  coverage on the TV for a week about their life story and interviews with  their grieving relatives. My death, if it was by Covid-19, would be  remembered, and my life would have mattered. As a young lad in my 20s,  my death would be used to save lives. I'd be used by the media as a  wake-up call to young people that even they can die from this silly flu,  and that they should stay at home. Then, many years hence, I would be  remembered as one of the honored martyrs that sacrificed their lives to  Covid-19. Every year, in April, there would be a nationwide memorial  service where the names of all those that died of coronavirus would be  read out, and fresh lilies and white doves released by my gravesite.

Covid-19: could anyone wish for a more beautiful death?

I invested everything I had into a partnership that came to a brutal end,5,g1eywb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1eywb/i_invested_everything_i_had_into_a_partnership/,1,1586930755.0,"I have very high expectations of myself and I've struggled to fulfil them. I have two, now three athletic careers to look back at that ended in failure just before I reached the goals I had respectively pursued for years with 100% dedication, training 15-20 hours a week.

I'm over thirty now and my last shot of making it was taken away from me because my partner (non romantic) decided that what I was delivering wasn't good enough. Our coaches thought it was going well but for her it just wasn't enough. I trusted her 100% and she revealed from one day to the next that she didn't see any future in us working together.

Instead of letting me go she kept me around for three months saying that just because she doesn't see a future doesn't mean there isn't any. That made no sense to me but I got so depressed that I just hoped it would somehow work out.

Three months later I finally packed my shit and moved back home. It's so crushing to have somebody you did everything for tell you she accepts that you did everything you could but it just isn't enough.

Instead of giving me a way to save myself she insisted on explaining why it's me that isn't good enough and that's the reason it's not working. None of this ""it's not you, it's me or it's us"" or whatever you say when you try to let somebody down gently. Then I got an email detailing all the shit that's wrong with me. All she wanted was me to validate how she was feeling which was that my best is not enough. How the fuck can she not see how cruel that is?

I had just quit my job to pursue this dream full time but that didn't matter to her either. She refuses to accept that you have some responsibility for the well being of a partner who depends on you. She sees nothing wrong with how she acted because it wasn't her intention to hurt me, just an unfortunate side effect. Hitler also had reasons and in his mind good intentions. That's no excuse.

She also said that I made her quit me by getting injured and being low on energy (because of depression I had just started getting treatment for). Maybe rape is the wrong word but I feel brutally abused and while it was going on I was told that it's my fault and shame on me for making her do that.

I'm usually good at processing breakups but this time I just can't. I got even more severely depressed and I can't get these thoughts out of head. How could she do this to me? Everybody thinks she's nice and a great person. This was my last chance of achieving the greatness I have been dreaming of for 18 years. I've never been this close and now I'm left with nothing. My whole identity has evaporated and now I don't know how to fill the void. There is basically no chance to find a new partner at this level so everything I've worked for is fucked.

To me it feels like failure to get a job and live a ""normal life"". It's not who I want to be but I'm out of options because somebody took my last option from me. Now I'm too old to do what I really wanted to do. Part of me refuses to accept this.

My girlfriend needs help.,9,g1ar6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1ar6u/my_girlfriend_needs_help/,4,1586917038.0,"Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling.

Nobody needs me.,0,g1liyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1liyj/nobody_needs_me/,1,1586956258.0,"Some days I feel like I'm doing okay and maybe I can deal with this. But some days... fuck me. On top of clinical depression, I have severe anxiety and PTSD.. My family lost our house in January and I moved from FL to AZ to be with my boyfriend and not homeless. But no matter what I do I'm never good enough for my family. I haven't ""sacrificed"" anything in their lives. They constantly remind me of my shortcomings and pick on me and he just begs me to ride it out until we can move our new trailer off their land so I don't have to deal with it anymore. Some days I feel like I can do it. But today.... fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This was a bad day.

I got randomly grabbed out of nowhere on the neck, picked on a little in a fun joking manner but my anxiety took it and ran, and I realized nobody needs me anymore. Nobody. At my home I had 12 pets. 4 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos. I lost 2 of the dogs and 3 of the cats. My leopard geckos are being housed with a friend but they can't take care of them much longer. My remaining dogs and cats, including my service dog, are with a foster mom. Since Coronavirus I lost my job and their trip (that I'm paying for) to me is postponed indefinitely. They've all accepted her as their mom.

My pitbull hated her new collar that I sent her at first because that was the collar she knew with me. But she also had it during 2 trips to the pound (when I adopted her she had it and when my mom dropped her at the pound she kept it before I had a friend readopt her for me as I was already across the country. I paid for it.) Today foster mom tells me she loves the new collar now. The old collar got brought out and she ran from it. She ran. She doesn't need me anymore. None of them do. My service dog accepted foster mom as new home within a week. Pitbull took 2 months but she's finally given up on me. My cats never needed me. I was a fool to think they did. I've never been without pets ever. I'm 19, we always had at least 3 in my household. They're my reason for living. I'm becoming a veterinarian to help them. I've wanted to since I was 9. But they don't need me. I'm useless. And worthless. I can't commit suicide because my instinct to survive is too strong. It's like my brain and heart want to die but my body won't give up on me. I can't bring myself to try. I can't even do that right...

Of my family, for which Im just a caretaker for my grandma and uncle (her son) for the rest of my fucking life, because nobody else cares about them, and partially I cannot blame them; grandma is not a nicest person to be around most of the time, let's put it this way, and I'm always around since i live with her.

Of my mother, who has been using me for so many years, just so everything will stay HER way. Telling me to cry when dad came home lately and ask him ""why are you not with me and mommy anymore, we're worried"", or to refuse his plushie bear he gave me on the children's day, just 'cause they were separated. Years later, when I run away from dad and went to live with grandma (that was long ago, when she wasn't that way she is now), she often told me how she always missed me and my sister, how she know that dad was manipulating me and ""forgives me"" for things I said when I WAS 7 GODDAMN YEARS OLD. how she went on rehab and was hardly drinking anymore, how she loved me and always would be here for me. And now? Anytime I went to visit her she was always drinking her ass off, making excuses as always. Wanted to intimidate me to cancel my plans to leave my city and move out to the other side of the country, saying that ""If i do it, i won't be having a mother anymore"". And honestly, yeah, she's right. I won't. I don't want a mother who cares so little about her fucking daughter that openly tells that ""she doesn't want to go with me to therapist 'cause she has better things to do and i simulate everything anyway"", and when I tried to open up to her that one goddamn time and told her about my self-harm problems and two suicide attempts, she just shrugged it off and said ""ah, okay, nice"". So, yeah. She's right. I don't have a mother anymore and I honestly don't know if I ever had one.

Of my father, who just... didn't cared then and doesn't care now. Who is able to go arm with arm with me on the street and pretend he don't see me, just to avoid conversation. Who has the balls to text me about ""how he misses us"" and ""how everyone is against him"", and then act like he doesn't know me, my sister, his siblings or his ex wife. But, well, at least he never tried to hide that he don't care.  


Of my sister, who is the only person in my whole family that I'm actually afraid my death would hurt more than a bit. She's just... too pure for her own good. When I couldn't hide that i'm crying she was trying to make a fucking ""memes"" out of random google images, just to make me laugh. And she was actually only one trying to be with me, understand, even tho she's only fucking 10 and i'm, well, a shitty person in general and a lot more shitty older sister. I don't want to push her away, so my death would be less painful for her, but I also don't want her to be hurt in any way, especially not because of me. I don't know what to do.

Of my friends, who just.. I'm too attached to to just leave them like that. I know that they don't care about me that much, that when I die all it will take for them to forget about me is just a couple weeks, but i care about them. If I'm useful to them, if I can help them with their own problems, If i can do anything to make them feel better and have better lives than they have now, I have to fucking do it. Even if that will take years, I want them to be happy. And still... I'm so tired of this perspective and my selfishness. That I can't just end it now, that I HAVE TO keep going for them, to help them overcome their own problems, that I have to keep waiting even for years to finally feel good with myself ending all of this and even though I will always be for them just a third wheel, just this weird girl who they can always talk to when their better friends aren't around.Of me, not being able to handle everything that's going on.

Of my fucking mind not being able to do things properly, care about myself, my future and self-care anymore. Of being too fucked up to even pass my last year of high school. Of not getting over an ended friendship (toxic as fuck, but still) with a girl I can't stop feel something to, even if she had made my mind even bigger mess that it was already, telling me that ""If i want to kill myself that much, then I should do it now, 'cause only thing I deserve is to die alone"", of being unable to hate her, of being too shitty to do anything productive or learn anything useful. Of being always ""not good enough"". Of waiting.

I mostly got many C's from now on and rarely B.

When I was in high school and when my dad was able to drop me off at school, we never spoke to each other. Nothing was said from the time that I woke up to getting into his car to leaving. The most that he would say was “I’ll be in the car!” He was always on and off unemployment which sucked because my mom was in school and working a full time job. My dad would just complain that they were spending too much money on my education and kept asking me if I wanted to go to the local public school, not understanding the value of a private school education.  Though they all took turns parenting me, I was always distant with all of these family members. I remember coming home everyday, depressed just lying on the couch putting on the news everyday, just in my own little world. My grandma would come over to just do the dishes and leave. My mom wasn’t going to do the dishes after working day and night everyday and my dad didn’t want to do them. Whenever I tried talking to my mom she would ignore me, always stressed from having the workload and responsibility that she had. When she is stressed she shuts down. After awhile I gave up on my relationship with my mom. If she doesn’t want to talk to me she dosent have to to. But that’s the last person in people’s lives that they would expect to not regularly engage with them. I felt so alone, abandoned. I was late to school everyday, ate the same food and sat at a lunch table that I knew wouldn’t judge me. I wouldn’t always talk.

Saying that it’s in the past dosent change anything. I feel too proud to ask them for any help. I hired my psychiatrist and therapist for that. I wouldn’t want them to help me.

There is slow internet, my computer isn't great with running games, and going outside is, of course, out of the question. 

It's almost been a month of waking up, doing nothing, going to sleep. One can watch TV shows for only so long. 

I've been depressed for almost three years now. Depressed in the sense that I have no real ambitions, passions or physical skills that can help me out. I also have this feeling that I will never be ""somebody"". To top it all off, I've been extremely underweight for my age, have been shamed by peers since grade 1, and generally have never had a moment to look back on with pride. 

I am 23 and live with my parents. I have not told them about my depression, they simply would not get it. I don't blame them, no matter how and what they've done, they're the best parents anyone could've asked for. But the problem is me. I feel unimportant. Irrelevant. I just fucking miss going to uni because it was an escape from doing nothing.

**Sexual assault below** 

I was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade I was 11, maybe 12 at the time, it was in public by a peer and I knew other people who watched it happen but no one did or said anything so I did the same and at the time I never felt like it hadn't hurt me or anything, I didn't see my body any differently I didn't blame myself, nothing, I just passed it off and moved on with my life and that was fine...

**Drugs below**

But eventually I kinda thought about it and it all came crashing down, the realization of how much it actually did hurt me but I pushed it all deep down as a reflex and had no clue I was even doing it, as first I tried to get my mind off it with drugs, mainly weed, and at the lowest point when I was going to give up on myself, LSD, now for the average, healthy, responsible adult both drugs wont cause any physical damage as long as it was done in a safe place but both drugs were done when I was between 12 and 13 and only 2 or 3 I did drugs was I in a safe place and luckily the time I did LSD I was at least unable to hurt myself and didn't want to hurt others but I was at school.

**suic\*de below**

The day I did LSD I planed to go home that night and commit suic\*de but when I arrived at school a friend asked if I wanted to do LSD I said yes because I figured ""what do I have to lose?"" I was coming down from my high as I went home and by the time I arrived I was exhausted and ended up sleeping all day and into the next morning and had missed my only chance for months to come.

 **s\*lf h\*arm below**

So I moved onto the next coping mechanism I could think of which was self harm but after almost being caught time and time again, constantly needing to clean blood covered things, and my familys growing suspicion I had to give that up too which I wish I could say was for the best.

**eating disorder below**

The last thing I tried before I shoved the memory into the deepest part of my mind was to get a grip, have control over the one thing I could, what I ate, I knew right away that I wanted to starve myself unlike most stories of anorexia it didn't start as a diet, it started as eating as little as I could physically get away with, I managed to get down to 89 pounds before I passed out after not eating or 4 days whilst still burning over 2,000 calories a day with my active life style, sadly no one noticed do to the fact that I had told the only person that was home I was going to take a shower moments before passing out on my bed room floor luckily I wasn't out for very long and I was so scared by it that I ate right away and have been trying to get better for years but I keep relapsing.

I'm trying to figure a way to give my life a meaning, because I'm currently stuck with ""if I did that, then it means that I'd lie to myself. I'd be living a lie that I, myself created. For the purpose of not feeling depressed anymore, wouldn't I fall back to the hole I dug myself in when the time comes?""
So for the time being, life doesn't have meaning.

Still wondering if there is a way to shut them down, see if that's better. Managed a few times, but it's not consistent and not long enough for me to wonder if I could be like that for the rest of my life. 
To be frank I sometimes scare myself, I sometimes need to calm myself down.

Still trying to figure if I should tap in on my emotions and actually try to connect with a friend or a family member. I've always thought that to have a connection, you'd relate to one another, two distinguished lives having the same thoughts and feelings about the topics one would talk about, not completely identical, but enough to make you feel related as if you felt a connection right then and there.

And bunch of other things.. I feel that this is long enough.

And for the grand finale, life and death.
I've always perceived living as weird.
I still think about us being a side effect of whatever the hell this reality is supposed to be. And worse, if it had purpose. Why would that be? How would it work out? Who or what would be our purpose to fulfill?

I gotta say I have absolutely no desire to go back. I worked yesterday and I don’t know how I put myself through that on a daily basis. 

I hate my job but am grateful for it, and am aware of how this whole thing affects others negatively. I don’t wish harm on anyone. I’ve made other posts about this so I wont explain my disclaimer anymore lol.

The point is I didn’t get anything done today and am worried that tomorrow I’ll be too anxious to get anything done and that I’ll have to go back to work sooner than expected and then I really won’t be able to get anything done. I’m gonna try to sleep but that’s been difficult for me lately. This anxiety won’t help.

I was able to call friends and have a happy conversation instead of depressing ones. I was playing Xbox with my friends and genuinely enjoyed myself. Then my parents decided that staying up till 4am enjoying myself wasn’t normal. After I was doing that for 3 weeks and they knew I was doing it the entire time. Now since they decided that i was no longer normal they decided to do a strict “school schedule” while at home so they will plan when I wake up, when I eat, when I do online work, what I do in my “personal granted free time”. MY BODY STILL ISNT USED TO NOT GOING TO BED AT 4AM SO I DONT GET TIRED TILL THEN SO I GET 3 HOURS OF SLEEP SND THEY WONT LET ME NAP. It’s been happening for a week now. They act like it’s bringing our family together but me and my sister just hide in our rooms and that makes them unsettled. They also have scheduled times to go for a walk and to do a hand picked chore when there practically aren’t any left. I don’t see why they are doing this and I haven’t done anything wrong.

I did acid about 7 months ago with someone I'm no longer friends with because everyone around me was telling me that she was toxic for me. I eventually see a therapist because my friends recommended I do as I tended to lash out at them. The therapist tells me that I have PTSD. I've lost all of my friends because I think that they're all less mature than me and that I've outgrown all of them. The only reason I stick around is because I'll be alone and I'll blame myself. I see the world so differently, I know acid and my (current) weed usage that my mother is actually okay with. She allows me to smoke weed because she thinks it's helping with my anxiety. I try to convince myself it doesn't but deep down I know it is. I tried hydrocodone after fucking stealing from my grandpa's cabinet. I don't know if I'm a teenager acting out, or if something is seriously wrong with me. I'm failing school, literally. All F's and I have had all F's since 6th grade. Yet for some reason they never decided to hold me back. I wish they did, cause now I'm the really dumb freshman who's always missing school and smokes weed. I don't want to be known as that. My therapist tells me that I'm actually quite intelligent for my age. This quarantine has really been messing me up even more. I came in contact with weed again, I can't talk to my therapist anymore because of it, I'm eating more food, I lost my routine and stay up all hours of the night, and worst of all is that I haven't done a sliver of my home school work. I know I'm fucking up, everyone I ask this to tells me that I'll be okay and that I shouldn't worry. But I know they're lying, I wish I wasn't treated like such a fucking child. My dad has sending me voicemails saying that he's out of jail and talking to me like I'm still 10 years old. I don't know how to respond to him because I don't know him at all, all he used to do with me as a kid was do everything for me. But not actually letting me figure anything out on my own, same with my mom. Speaking of my mom, since I'm the only one living with her in a 2 bedroom apartment I realized that I've been through torture for so long. The name calling she does, I get called dumb, stupid, and a pig for no reason, she makes all of these mean noises when I even try to talk to her. My therapist tells me it's her way of coping with her own insecurities because she used to be overweight and some people do say she is a bit of an airhead. Lastly, I think I've realized that I have so much more stuff to go through. I thought I had the answer to everything, I thought I was psychic. I still sometimes think I am. And after looking at all of this your only question is probably ""how have you not killed yourself yet?"" and I don't know. I don't want to kill myself, I just wouldn't care if I died because I provide nothing either way.

Any advice helps,1,g1jzfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1jzfy/any_advice_helps/,2,1586949445.0,"Hi,

My name is Jarred and over the last year in my life I have had an ongoing issue of anxiety and depression. I began therapy for anxiety in October of this year which lead to a big drop in my overall anxiety, but I never really brought up depression, as I thought these feelings had direct correlation to my anxiety. However, as therapy went on I soon realized that my depression was an independent issue. But I decided not to bring it up as my mom, who put me into therapy (I was 17 at the time), and my therapist both believed my life was changing for the better and I was a much happier person. The whole goal of therapy was to get my anxiety ready for me to move out and go to college come August and in the eyes of my therapist and mother, I have reached that point.

Fast forward to today. I recently started dating a girl I met at work and our relationship has surpassed any expectations I had for it. I am very happy to say I love my girlfriend and she makes me very happy. However, my depression really drags me down at times and I have constant feelings that I am worthless and I will often feel insecure about myself. I have very few friends and at times I feel like I have nobody in my life. The only person I have to turn to when I am feeling this way is my girlfriend. While she makes me feel much better about myself and cares a ton about my mental health, I feel like I vent to her too much and if I countinue like this she will end up leaving me. So I resort to crying by myself and feeling like total shit. I do not know where these feelings come from or what to do, and I feel just as lonely as I did before I had my girlfriend sometimes. Please give me any advice you feel could help my situation. Thanks.",Depression

>
>""this medicine will help""
>
>""You're valuable""

To say I've had a ""bad"" experience with the Mental Health industry is disingenuous. All my former counselors are good people. but interacting with them doesn't go anywhere. My past has *not* strengthened me. It has *not* gotten better. The medicine did *not* help. I'm *not* valuable. And please, don't bother disagreeing with that last one in the comments. That'll save us both some energy and time. That's not the point of the post, I've spent far too much energy and time discussing that with the  Mental Health industry. Thanks.

I've long held the position that if I ever end up in the hospital again, I'd never leave. because there's no growth, no plan for my future or any future. no hope for me. This is where I am, and I can't get better or worse, I can only *appear* differently, and only in the short term. Even that I think is lost for me because I can't pretend anymore. I can't pretend that this isn't how things are, and can't pretend that this isn't how things will be.

So why am I here? because in all that I have experienced, no one has agreed with me, ever. no one has actually considered or entertained my position. no one has said *""you're right, 14ierophant: that life sucks, that you're going to die, and that everything would be better if it happened soon. ****In the meantime, here's what you can do****.""*

I have to provide something otherwise they’ll get tired of me. It’s just easier by myself. When there’s no pressure to be interesting or engaging.

I remember growing up, I’d constantly change myself to suit who I was with. I’d change my personality for the sake of getting along with someone. Now, I feel like I don’t really have a personality. I bore myself with things I say and I find myself annoying. I’m not funny at all and I’m not intelligent or knowledgable and I have nothing witty or wise to say.

For these reasons I don’t really talk. I struggle with one-on-one conversations with another person. So, I can forget about group conversations or mealtime chit chat. I just don’t have anything to add. I can’t even bring myself to answer the door or pick up the phone.

Recently I’ve noticed that I’m distancing myself a lot. I don’t reach out to my friends. The conversations I have with my boyfriend these days are very repetitive and I’m worried that he’ll get bored of me and realise that I’m not as interesting as he thought. Because when he sees past his rose coloured glasses and notices that I’m not as exciting as he thought, he’ll leave. He’s the most meaningful person in my life.

I’ve never been super close to my parents. My mum even confronted me recently about how “I don’t even want to be her friend”. I feel terrible and she seemed hurt but honestly, I don’t think I can ever fully open up to someone. Not even my mum. I don’t think she’d wouldn’t like me. We are very different.

Im scared that when I transition to a new school in September, I’ll be too guarded to even try and interact with people. Then I’ll get left behind and have to spend the next two years without anyone.

"Am I really depressed, or am I just pretending I am? [16M]",1,g1j94e,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1j94e/am_i_really_depressed_or_am_i_just_pretending_i/,1,1586946425.0,"Note: Coming back after writing this, I realize I kinda get all over the place for me. I'd appreciate if you stick with me and keep reading through. Thanks.

Hey, I don't really know how to start this, but I feel like I might be depressed, but I don't know if it's just a ""Boo-hoo, I have a small problem in my life and I'm now depressed,"" which I really hate and do not want to be (I remember doing something like this where I was making jokes about depression and saying I had it - this felt this was definitely faked looking back, and I feel like a complete asshole for doing that, especially to a person who actually has depression (it almost felt like I was making fun of depression) - this is something I will hate myself forever for doing and wish I could take back so bad - I really do not want to relapse onto this behavior - I might have been doing this for the attention, but I really was not sure why I did this at the time). Basically, I \*really\* don't want to be a dick, and part of me keeps telling myself I am really just faking all of this.

I've been questioning myself about this often now, I tried denying it to myself, but I don't know.

Recently I feel like I just stopped caring for some things, especially school-work. I know I used to get anxious if I didn't turn stuff in the day it was due, or that I need to study for a particular assessment, but recently, I had that feeling disappear. I keep pushing deadlines, and I have tonnes of stuff to make up, but I haven't felt the same tension to work that I used to (this is something my mom pointed out) - making me feel lazier. I often now go into class without finishing assignments, pushing them back forever. And also, I feel a severe lack of motivation to do this work - I'm always procrastinating by watching YouTube or whatever. This made my grade drop by a lot - I usually get pretty good grades (A-B), but my last semester has been complete shit (A-C - and low C because I have not turned things in). This is making me worry I could lose my honors classes, which I really do not want to lose and is something I am stressed out about. These grades are not me, and my parents are saying I should drop these classes (which I really don't want to). I feel like it's easy and I can do it, but my grade does not paint the same picture. I want to be able to do my work, and get my grade up, but I just can't motivate myself anymore - or something is going on but I'm not sure. Yet, I am also scared as hell about losing my classes. I just don't get it.

This lack of working has given extreme frustration from my parents. It feels like everyday I'm getting yelled at for not doing my work, or at least doing enough. And when I do some of it, I have so much to catch up on, so ultimately it feels like I barely did anything, and I feel like my parents think the same, even though I sometimes spend hours catching up (also counting for when I distract myself on whatever), I get nothing - no break - no time to relax - and have to use means that I am not allowed to do to get something (like procrastinating even more or staying up late). My mom brought up concerns about a possible attention disorder, but I pushed it aside. After all, I don't want to be the kid with an attention disorder, now do I? It feels like an endless cycle I can't break.

My grades and all that jazz has lead me to lose a lot of my electronics as well. The thing is, I always feel like I really want to do something, like maybe play a game, make a video, anything inspiring, and I just can't because I'm fucking grounded. I want to go and play something on my console, because I feel like I can be happy doing that (and is something I really enjoyed), but I can't because I had that taken for saying some nasty stuff (I will touch up on this later). I also had (right now) my phone taken for, literally no reason. I know this sounds really cliche and stupid, but I feel like the things that make me happy or bring me joy are all gone. Maybe I'm being a whiny teenager who just is not thankful enough...

I also found myself getting a lot more aggressive and angry. My dad has always been a bit shouty and aggressive. He can never command me to do something while also being nice - he always rudely tells me to do whatever. I have lately been whispering stuff back (i.e: Fuck you, What an asshole, etc.) I have not always been this aggressive, but I feel myself going there. And going purely based on emotion, I fucking hate him - he can't ever leave me alone and give me privacy, and he is such an asshole by taking shit whenever he feels like it with no justification needed. He is always asking about my homework, and making it seem like I put less effort than what I really did. He keeps bringing up my work, always telling me off about it, and it's not doing me any good, and I am getting to a point where I can't fucking stand it. (Sorry, I needed that rant - I don't know if I really meant any of it - maybe I am just a normal teen going through teen stuff). I also see myself seething at trivial things, for example, right now when people are coming in my room while writing this, or when my room door was forced wide open by my parents to check in my work while writing this (probably because I want to keep this secret from them - I'll dive into this later). I don't know why I'm doing this, and it's all probably going worse with the quarantine.

I've seen myself going to the bathroom to just sit there in silence and sadness and just feeling horrible in general (usually after my dad has decided to yell at me or whatever), and bleary eyed, have to forcibly tell myself over and over again, ""I'm okay."" before I can come back out. This has been happening quite a lot.

Recently, I had an event of me just crying for no explainable reason. I went into my room and started crying. I tried to deny this. When my dad came in and asked what was wrong, he came in angry and shouting about it, and when I couldn't tell him, he got more and more furious (it almost felt like he was forced to come in - not doing this because he genuinely wanted to). My dad left out of anger and frustration, to where my mom came in and, well, just handled it a lot better. This happened once. Later in the day, my mom asked if I was depressed, to where I didn't know what to answer with, so I just said no (while kinda laughing it off).

I also caught myself eating more. Like, going into the kitchen to grab a snack for no reason. I'm not even hungry - and (context - am already a bit chubby) feel really unhealthy and bad about it. I don't know why I do this.

All these issues have all been highlighted and intensified by the quarantine we are having - especially not being able to go out (as it feels like going to school really helped me with this stuff - it was a place to get away from my parents).

\*These next two things are something I am going to find really difficult talking about (I really tried to avoid talking about these things), and frankly, I am not comfortable having online, but screw it, here it goes.\*

I have recently been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have been visualizing myself dead. Of course, I don't really want to die, but I have been thinking about it a lot - probably too much. I've also done self harm before and recently (cutting my leg), but that was either for me lashing out onto myself, or attention, or maybe both. I don't know. When my parents found out, I wanted comfort, but instead I got a yelling. I also had an incident where I was close to suicide (the issue was frankly, really dumb and it was probably more for attention than anything else), but I knew I didn't really want to die.

I also have an avid masturbation/porn addiction. It's really not doing my any well. My parents found out about this, and they (currently) are not that suspicious of it, but truly, I still have been doing it. I really hate this part of me, and want to change, but I keep relapsing. I know it's wrong (that's what religion says (plus that lives will be terrible with people who follow this path - which I am worried now that is applied to me)). I hope this isn't what brings me to hell (which speaking of, I also lately haven't been praying all that much, so that may also be a cause).

This has all taken me forever to write, and now that I just finished pouring my heart out, I should probably say I haven't told anyone all of this. Anyone. I'm scared of having depression (I don't want to have it - it would suck to be known as the one depressed kid), I don't want to go through therapy, and I don't fancy telling very many people this. I want to be normal.

I think I got everything, but I may come back to this if I feel like I missed talking about something. If you actually bothered reading through this mess, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just felt like I needed to let this all out - everything that has been bothering me - and I really appreciate you reading this. <3

I am stuck at work at the moment I might need to put up an all-nighter since last week I could not get out of bed and I have fallen behind with Uni and work stuff. To be honest I am falling apart but I am a pretty good actor, so no one has noticed. My depression comes and goes, and this time its horrible. My whole body feels heavy, especially my chest, I can feel my heart pounding the whole time. 

My thoughts are racing and the only thing that I want is to go to bed, hide my head under the cushion, and cease to exist. The worst part is this feeling in my head and eyes.   
Do you know that feeling that you get when you are emotional, seconds before you start crying?  
Like when you are cutting onions and you try to hold your tears back. For some days I have been constantly feeling like that. It is truly horrible. I want to scream, hit the wall with my head until it stops and then some more.  
Aside from that I am a fucking Idiot, due to some stupid decisions I now only have around 15 euros in my bank account. I truly loath myself. If I could somehow get out of this body and be in the same room with myself, I would beat me up until I showed some of the drive that I used to have in my teens.  


My thoughts are not even that consistent at the moment. I can feel insanely sad and angry and then suddenly feel as dry as sand emotionally.  


I wish I had someone to share this to be honest, I wish I could would feel loved.   


As the sun is setting down and I am here alone, I have this faint voice that tells me to jump outside the window. But shit, have you ever tried jumping outside a window?

Memories start to pop up in your head, of people who love you, mom, dad, friends.

I can’t do everything for everyone (I have some extremely needy men in my life!). 

So I was told to rest and they would take care of everything. Except they’re not. They’re letting my body rest when it’s my MIND that needs a break.

How can I communicate to them that I’m not capable of all this right now? You’d think that the fact that I start crying hysterically, pulling at my hair, and screaming “I can’t do this!!!!” when they ask me for help would be a good clue. But they still don’t get it. 

I’m in serious, serious trouble. I haven’t had a depressive episode this bad in years. To top it all off, my husband lost his job and we don’t have health insurance. I’m trying to take care of myself the only way I know how, but they’re making it impossible.

I haven't slept in days,3,g1cdig,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1cdig/i_havent_slept_in_days/,1,1586922155.0,"It's been a couple month since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.

Sorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.

Also I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.

My mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.

Edit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid.",Depression

With that realization i also realized that i’ll never be anything either. I’ll be just like him, just a regular person who will live a regular life and then die and be forgotten.

I think her long illness and repeated improvements lulled me into a false sense of ""theres still time"".

My mother was put into hospice again on Friday April 3rd and told she had a ""few weeks"". This time I knew it was for real. I saw her on Saturday and on Monday and she seemed to be doing pretty well and she texted me on Wednesday saying that she felt she was going to linger a week or two more. Instead she died on Friday the 10th. 2 days after that text. She was only home a week before she died.

My sister flew in to be with her the second she was released from the hospital and put into hospice. I work in an ER so I am considered high risk in these COVID19 times so I just visited 2 times from the day she came home from the hospital to the day she died and both times I had to maintain some distance, I couldn't hug her, and my sister didn't want me staying very long (1-2 hours). I tried to see her on Thursday but she said she was too tired for a ""visit"". So I finally got fed up with not seeing her more and I applied for FMLA so I could be with her 100% until she died. Make more memories. Take care of her. Not just be a ""visitor"" but be her \*daughter\*. But the day I FINALLY decided to do that, the next day, thinking she had at least another week for me to be with her, she suddenly crashed and died. I waited too long. WHY DID I WAIT AT ALL? Why didn't I understand how little time she had left? Why did it even matter? Why didn't I call my work the second she got released from the hospital and said, ""I'm not coming back to work until she has passed, no matter how long that takes"" or just quit and told them to use my PTO to cover my last 2 weeks. The stupidest thing is, I was going to quit my job soon anyways because I'm going to grad school. I think I just got hung up on being afraid to lose my health insurance, or being unemployed for months, or thinking I couldn't be gone for weeks (when i thought she would last weeks). But none of those things actually mattered. I didn't even have a financial incentive to stay because my dad told me he would cover my expenses until I left for grad school if I wanted to quit. I thought about FMLA but didn't apply for it until it was too late.

I managed to get there in time to say my goodbyes, I got to tell her I loved her and she managed to say it back, and I stayed with her in her final hours although she was heavily sedated. But I cant forgive myself for not being there with her in those last days. I COULD'VE BEEN THERE, getting hugs and watching tv with her and saying goodnight to her in person every single night.....and I wasn't. She probably thought I cared more about my stupid fucking job than her.

I just don't understand how stupid I was. Why did I keep delaying leaving my job, when I was going to quit soon anyways? Why did I assume she had weeks, I should've known she could die at any minute? Why didn't I press my sister to let me be there more? Why was I ever content with ""visits""? Why didn't I even consider being there 24/7 until it was too late?

I have no real good excuse for why I didn't quit, why I wasn't there with her. I honestly don't understand what I was thinking.

I could’ve been there and I wasn't. Day after day. I'll never be able to forgive myself. All the time and memories lost. I could've gotten hugs. I can't even remember the last time I got a hug from my mother because of COVID19.

I don't want to focus 2 years on recovering not being able to do nothing due to depression and me getting eaten alive by my own thoughts like what happened after graduation...

How do I avoid thinking about the girl I had a crush on for 5 years now since 2013...

We somehow agreed to stay friends after grad but some time after that we pretty much became strangers to each other and now I don't know what to do...Should I just toughen it out like I'm used to until it goes away?

I can answer anything that I might have missed, in the comments if it helps to find an answer...",Depression

Successful treatment of Dysthymia?,1,g1htre,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1htre/successful_treatment_of_dysthymia/,2,1586940813.0,"I would wager that I suffer from dysthymia from early childhood, but due to the nature of the disorder as it is hard to diagnose I am only being seriously treated for around 5 years. I am 25.  
As I am descending into another episode of double depression, I was wondering if anyone can share an experience of overcoming such disorder. I feel as if i'm locked into a cycle: I am fighting my way out, and for a while it seems like the medication have helped me stabilize, but I just dive down again.

Returning with less and less strength each time, with a lower and lower starting point it seems. I really hope I make it through this one, But honestly I am both exhausted and hopeless. If you are willing to share, I would be glad to hear how you broke the cycle, or how are you still going through it.

My OCD causing constant over thinking. Almost every second of everyday I’m doing checking rituals. I have magical thinking which means I think I can make things happen with my thoughts if I don’t do certain stuff. I can’t enjoy anything because as soon as I do I feel guilty for stopping obsessing about the thoughts. Then I get intrusive thoughts about the thing. So I just flick back through the same apps everyday, stuck in my head trying to control my hole life. I try to go for a walk everyday but I’m overthinking the whole time. Literally anything triggers me. Any decision I try to make ocd comes in and tries to force me into something I don’t want to do. I want toast? No ocd wants me to have cereal or something bad will happen. I want to message a friend? ocd wants me to send exactly the right message, normally something I don’t even want to say. Then I end up talking and talking and probably annoying people.

Then on top of the is the feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough. From years of bullying at school. Then the guilt for the nasty ways I treated my friends because I wanted to look cool so made fun of them. Knowing if I didn’t my best friend would get mad at me. Saying I didn’t like her for hanging round with them.

And finally there’s the years of abuse from my alcoholic mother. Leaving me on my own at night. Coming home all bruised and bleeding. Forcing me to hug her when I didn’t want to. Calling me a freak, a bitch, telling me to fuck off. Gaslighting me constantly. Trying to kill her self in front of me and screaming at me to give her pills.

I’m just so broken. Life was getting better. My mother’s in prison now. I thought things were looking up but my ocd was worse. And then this lockdown and I’m backing to thinking “how do I do another potential 60 years of this hell that is life”

And I know this post is ranty, but I needed to get my feelings out. And no I’m not going to do anything. I’m too scared to kill myself. I don’t even want to die I just want the pain to stop. I want to finally be happy.",Depression

I’d like to think that depression itself isn’t that big of an issue for me and wouldn’t be the reason for potential suicide.

I feel like if I ever did it, it would be because of the constant arguing and switching in my head, and also my consistently worsening grip on reality. It’s driving me insane and I hate living like this. This is mostly a post I’m making while having anxiety, so no I’m not talking about committing suicide right now I’m talking about the future.

I have a LOT of potential, and I have a lot of plans and methods that could get me successful and rich in the future, I know that and I know other people have told me that, the problem is I have no motivation to. And even if I do, first of all I’d have to get better.

What if I get better, end up thinking everything is fine, I move on with everything and eventually find a girlfriend, and I relapse into these same thoughts? Even if I do get better, I’m going to constantly live with the fear of a trigger activating and me lashing out.

The only reason I am seeking therapy right now is because some people believe I can be helped, even though I continue to believe I’m completely out of reach and beyond help at this point. I think there really is just a point where someone has been through so much that nobody is capable of helping them. 

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a big deal if I didn’t have certain triggers, because then my dark thoughts could be easily drowned out, but no, my mom had to be a despicable piece of shit and treat me horribly. And of course, dad was never there, and when he was, he was raping my mom and forced me to watch, so god knows what fucking psychological impact that had on my brain.

I’m not sure I can even push this shit out of my head. I’ve tried overpowering my triggers and telling myself “it’s fine it’s whatever it doesn’t matter you’ll get past it” and it just makes the triggers worse. 

It’s to the point where any amount, even an insignificant amount, of any representation of anxiety from rejection and abandonment, can set me off. Even if I wasn’t self isolating, I legitimately don’t understand basic, normal human interaction and I can barely even talk to anyone properly. I don’t know what normal friendships and relationships are. I’ve never known, and I don’t know what love is and I can’t love, which I’ve explained before I think.

Sorry I can’t really stick to one train of thought with these posts. I’ll be really surprised if someone can somehow get into my head, get past all the split personalities, get past all the manipulation and lying and fake personas, and convince ME that I can get better, that life is worth living, and that someday I won’t feel like such a danger.",Depression

He used to hit me when he was mad. He cheated on me. We’d had a fight right before it happened. I’d been pregnant two weeks prior. 

I literally cannot focus on anything anymore. My family and friends are all anti therapy and anti meds so I’ve been trying not to go. They tell me not to then they leave me alone. I am always in a dense fog on my own here. I cannot remember the feeling of joy. Nor the feeling of sadness. I just exist, pretending to have emotions so people think I’m ok and so I don’t make them uncomfortable.

Unable to appreciate the now, always assuming there is more to life and never able to accept things the way they are. I think back to the perfectly trimmed memories I have of days before I felt this way and I disregard any notion of nostalgia and assume that in those moments, I felt as happy as those memories seem. I am always chasing that impossible feeling of peace and satisfaction and it often comes in the form of flashbulb visions

I can be thinking about or doing whatever, and a random flash of an unknown setting will commandeer my mind for a second. There are some that reoccur and some that are fresh every time. Sometimes its just a staircase of a home that is incandescently lit, sometimes its a night at home in an apartment I've never seen. Just like a dream, there can be context for the vision. This comes in the form of details about my life at the time. It could be 20 years form now with a family that I love. Whatever it is, it's random and and torturous. Its like a fishing line with bait that is constantly held above my head, taunting me for my inability to attain satisfaction. I don't know what these are trying to tell me but they are a constant reminder that I am not satisfied with what I have. 

I often get lost in the fleeting image that has been left behind after it happens. I struggle with a near obsession with escapism in my lower moods and these visions walk hand in hand with that. I spiral into a jealousy for a dream that is impossible and with every jealous mood I grow farther from accepting reality as it is, allowing me to finally be happy or at peace.

Does anyone else feel similar or experience anything of the sort? I was just writing this to get my thoughts into words but I would appreciate some discussion. I feel very alone in this.",Depression

I took Zoloft at varying dosages, at some points alongside Wellbutrin. Zoloft helped with the extreme lows of depression, but I still felt significantly depressed in addition to feeling numb/flat, almost unable to fully experience happiness. I have been off medication entirely for around 6 months. In the last couple of months, I started going to the gym almost everyday, taking omega 3s, taking vitamin D, occasionally using light therapy, and trying to get my sleep schedule together. I was definitely still depressed but felt wayyy better than when I was on Zoloft. 

My mental health changed for the worse very suddenly though when an ex came back into my life (bringing up old wounds that haven't healed) at the same time this pandemic began. I ended up losing my job. I've been sleeping around 12 hours and once I wake up, lay in bed all day. I constantly feel like I'm going to cry, I've tried my best to continue exercising but I'm finding it very difficult. Yesterday I went for a walk/jog on a trail and ended up crying my eyes out (luckily I was alone in the middle of nowhere haha). I don't necessarily have a plan, but I think very often about killing or hurting myself. It's something I've caught myself fantasizing about often, even though I know it's not something I could go through with. 

I had a Facetime appointment with my PCP today. She prescribed me Viibryd, along with Zofran for the nausea side effects. She said if it was too expensive, we could try Cymbalta instead. I haven't gone to pick it up yet, but the Walgreens website says it's $71 with my insurance. I found a coupon I saw people mention online and am going to try to use it. I'm wondering though if Viibryd is worth the cost?  I've read good things about Viibryd from people who failed to respond to different antidepressants. I'm also wondering how people who don't respond to antidepressants like Cymbalta?

Quick summary: S.O. of three years has had a history of depression and I think it is very bad right now (seeing a psychiatrist this week, makes constant suicidal thoughts). Our first year was really great but she got pregnant accidentally, it was stressful but we moved in together and started making it work. Ever since she was pregnant, and even after baby our relationship has been on a downward trajectory (sometimes it had highlights).

Specifically some major things are our intimacy fell off a cliff (which has been huge for me, she says I am gross, doesnt find me attractive, 'not a real man' etc), she tears me down a lot, says I am stupid, lazy, NEVER wants to hug/kiss/hold hands, tells me she hates my family (we are living with them right now for free for the last half year, and they really went out of their way to try to make her feel welcome), doesnt like doing anything fun any more, ALWAYS wants to fight etc etc.

I am not perfect at all, and I have gone way out of my way to listen to her, to fix whatever she is angry about and all it does is make her want more and more. We had a huge fight (seems like 1/week honestly) where she saw I was texting my sister and friends asking for relationship advice and had some huge melt down that I 'betrayed her' and she took baby and drove a few hours to her parents and said she is never coming back and I can get baby in a week.

My question is can depression 'change' someone this much? She was once very loving, very caring, someone I ENJOYED being with. These days it feels like I am just care taking someone on the verge of admitted self-destruction. I feel trapped because we have a kid together. I truly want it to work out, but likewise if she really just 'hates me', doesnt want to hold hands, thinks I am so stupid and gross not sure what future there is. I am secretly hoping this isn't the 'real her'. Can you guys give me a little insight? Thanks",Depression

I see on here a lot that a lot of people tend to isolate themselves anyways due to their depression. I have the opposite problem.

I hang out with my family (My parents, grandma, and a couple cousins I'm close with) and my boyfriend. I work 48 hours a week and on my off days I'm usually with my boyfriend, at one of my parent's house or at one of my two cousin's houses.

This quarantine is making me crazy and I'm starting to get really depressed. I was still hanging out with my boyfriend and parents since I've been laid off but now that the stay at home order (I live in Michigan) is starting to get more strict I've been trying to be more safe. 

My parents last week told me they don't want me over anymore for a bit (which I understand). My boyfriend was over yesterday and I told him I don't want him over anymore for a bit (I don't really have a for sure time line right now, but probably until the stay at home order is no longer in effect) because he's still working. If he wasn't working I wouldn't mind but he works with other people and I know he's not being as cautious as he should be (Not wearing mask and gloves). 

I live alone and don't really have any hobbies. All I've been doing when I'm not with my parents is watching TV, reading, going for walks, and playing around on my phone. All of that stuff was getting boring anyways but I at least was able to break it up a bit by seeing my parents and having my boyfriend over. Now I can't do that so I'm just gonna be doing the same few boring things every day. I live alone too so I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I had the talk with my boyfriend Sunday and decided to have him stay over one more night (yesterday) and then no more for awhile. All I've done the last couple days is cry. All I think about is being alone the next few weeks. I feel like I'm not gonna make it.

I didn't know if this is the right place, but I just need this to be heard.

&#x200B;

I am 15, and I right to you from the middle of a coronavirus lockdown. Luckily, where I live my country has been very proactive and has a had a low fatality rate, but that is besides the point. The national quarantine has given me time to reflect on my life and I don't know what to do with my findings.

&#x200B;

I come from a very loving family, who gave me the best life and love possible. But for as long as I can remember (until recently, more about that later) and according to my parents I had anxiety starting at age 2. This impacted me on a completely different scale that I can't barely begin to describe. I hated myself. I hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I walked. You name it, I hated it. This day to day alienation of myself as a person stopped me from living a normal child's life. I never signed up for sports, or for music or nothing. I never had the confidence to even take the chance - because I always felt that I was so wrong the less chance I had to be wrong the easier my life would be. I would turn down birthday parties and other social events because I didn't want to say something or be judged or make a bad impression etc. I remember in my first year of primary school, we were played this movie about an orphanage, who had a caregiver who banned all stuffed animals and teddys (probably not the best movie to show to a bunch of 5 years old). This lady hated them so much she would burn them and make the kids watch. I can vividly remember coming home that day, quiet, acting like it was a normal school day - but there was one thought I could never clear my head off. The burning of the toys. It wasn't until that night and from memory about two months after where I would hide my stuffed animals under my pillow when I went to bed, and kept myself awake - on guard almost in case such a thing happened to me as well. That is something my parents never found out about. At the age of five, I can remember being worried that my house was going to burn down in my sleep, to the point where I would keep all my most treasured belongings in plastic bags, ready to flee the house with. I can remember being scared that someone was going to murder me in my sleep or kidnap me and hold me hostage till the day I die. I suffered from much more intense and violent nightmares than my peers. The thing that I am still confused about, is that despite that I lives in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country and had a caring family, was that I still suffered from these things. I was so worried about things getting broken or something going wrong, that despite how desperately I wanted something to work or happen, I was too scared of failure to even try in the first place. I was always trying to be the happy/friendly kid, just for the sake of everyone else which made sadly too much sense at the time, but now it makes no sense..

&#x200B;

Like all people (i hope) we carry burdens. My burdens was that my grandfather died when I was seven, due to cancer. The day of his funeral, I was asked by my parents if I wanted to go and I was so worried about looking weak and upset, that I went to school like it was a normal day, while the rest of my family faced something I can't even imagine now. I remember hating myself for years and years over that decision, because I loved him to bits and I never got the chance to say goodbye. My only memory of him is me returning home from school that day, and my dad showing ""program"" and me seeing his photo on the front page. I have never been to his grave since because a) I am to scared to ask my parents where it is because I am worried about opening up and b) the fear that it will worsen my feelings now. My lack of attendance at his funeral ate me away inside for years, I remember weeks on end where I would cry myself to sleep in silence each night, but never told my parents and still haven't. It was only when I had a breakdown in I think at the start of Grade 8 when I only told my mum half the story, the regret. Not the amount of pain it caused me. I don't think I'll ever be able to tell them because it sounds just too pathetic. 

&#x200B;

It wasn't the middle of Grade 8, that I began to get a grip back on my life. At my school, in eight grade it was compulsory to take a performing arts subject, this could either be music, art, drama or dance. You could either do two arts for one semester each or one for the whole academic year. So I choose 1 semester of drama and 1 semester on dance. I only choose these because I didn't know what else to do. These classes were mixed gender, which I found really hard because for Grade 1-5 I was at a mixed gender school and then 6-7 I was at a boys only. I found it hard because I had barely settled in and any sense of security or even a wall to hide behind was completely removed. I found the first few weeks of the course really hard, could barley look anyone straight in the eyes and mumbled my way through every social situation, even if it was a simple ""Hey! How are you?"". I just couldn't do it. I remember considering dropping out and changing to music, and my mum said to me ""Just give it some time, it will be fine."" And I have been so happy that I listened to that advice. I owe my happiness and emotional freedom in life to my drama teacher, she pushed me and pushed me, to achieve confidence and it payed off. It was so successful to the point where I changed to a full year course, took for the whole year in Grade 9 and the same in Grade 10. I even signed up for the school's musical which sadly got cancelled, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

However, despite that I now have been dealing with the same sort of issues/dreams/constant pessimism again like when I was five. Recently, I have been so worried about death due to the coronavirus that on a frequent level I am having dreams involving comas, death of whole family etc. I seem to be more and more often wishing I wasn't who I am. On a frequent scale, I think to myself ""Imagine how good my life would be if I was born in the UK"" etc. Sometimes I wish I am a celebrity or sadly just someone who gets heaps of attention.

I've dealt with anxiety, destructive friendships, fear of going out of my house,bullying, a bitter divorce who left me as the only one to take care of my mom emotionally so I had to hide my feelings just to avoid my mom to get sad. In fact, when I finally hit rock bottom was so bad that I wished for my death. 

I've come out of them thanks to having friends and the improvement of the situation of me and my mom. But since, last year depression returned. First, it was realising how I chose a career that I ended up hating, then graduating and being unable to find a job. Then realising how my friendships had started to fade away as they are beginning to have relationships and it made me worry about a near future when I will be the only lonely guy of the group. 

It doesn't help that I feel my sexuality is a nightmare. I pray every night to be cured. I've been to lgbt groups but I just doesn't feel related to the things there, if anything it made me feel worse to be with people who put their sexuality as their main personality trait and it doesn't help that I live in such an homophobic country that coming out would cost me even the relationship with my mom, the only true love I have.  I don't think life would be better if I was straight as I already struggle with sharing my feelings and I'm not a very romantic person but at least I could live a normal life like the ones my friends are already having. Love is nothing more than an ilussion for sex. Isn't that's the reason why so many marriages fall apart?

And I don't think it will get better, if anything it will get worse as soon as my friends start to get married and having children. (In fairness, I would like to have a kid through adoption but I don't know if single parents can adopt). Having to live for a job I'll probably hate and now due to the economic crisis that the virus will cause around the world, my plan to study in Spain is likely delayed. I love my teenage years because at least being a top grades kid made my life have a meaning but now, it's sad to see even the kids who were my former bullies improving in their lifes.

Progress concerns,2,g1baem,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1baem/progress_concerns/,0,1586918761.0,"I have been in and out of therapy for 3 years but my slow progress with my current T has been discouraging me from coming in because it feels like I’m not getting better. When Im in therapy, It feels so uncomfortable looking at each other when none of us know what to say. My poor memory makes it very difficult to talk about anything. How can I talk about anything when I cant remember anything? Im just forcing things out. This makes me start thinking that Im wasting my time and money which makes me feel guilty about going. I get out what I put in. I write long notes before each session but It dosent always help the conversation going. My low tolerance for frustration, poor motivation, impulsiveness, pettiness, unrealistic expectations and crazy work schedules has made it difficult for me to be in therapy at times.

When I first started I thought that I could just show up and have my therapist make me feel better. I thought that I could quickly get rid of my suicidal thoughts after a few months, recover from withdrawal and never look back on seeing a therapist/pdoc ever again.",Depression

My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”",Depression
How can I tell my mom I don't believe in God?,1,g1d88p,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1d88p/how_can_i_tell_my_mom_i_dont_believe_in_god/,0,1586924915.0,"I'm a 16-year-old guy from South America. My family have been Christians for their whole lives, and I had been too, until around 3 years ago.  I don't know why I started doubting my faith, but the fact is I don't believe in God anymore.  For 3 years I've been acting as if I did believe, and even if tedious, it hasn't been that difficult. Before proceeding, I need to say I've been suffering from depression and other issues. In the last year and a half approximately, I've been just getting worse and worse. I told my parents and they took me to a therapist ( thankfully), but my mom says that the efforts of anyone to help are futile without the help of God. I think I could go through with this and continue lying, but I also think I need to say the truth to her. Luckily, my mom and my dad have been trying to help me with my mood, and I really don't want to cause them more trouble. That's the thing; I feel like I'm tearing my family apart ( my mom has even said that because of me she wished she didn't live here, she's not to be blamed for that, though), and I don't want to cause them more trouble. Like faithful Christians, my parents' lives revolve around God ( especially my mom's). I'm really scared of messing this up and ruining everything. Any help will be appreciated.",Depression

This year...,6,g12cjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g12cjb/this_year/,2,1586884769.0,"It was going to be one of the greatest years of my life. 2019 had been one of the worst years I've ever been through. Depression, suicidal thought (almost daily), strained relationship with my father, the death of my dog (who's saved me from ending it earlier in my life), my ""best friend"" consistently being a dick to me throughout the entire year, etc. etc. etc.

Somehow, in january this year, something snapped in me. I was going to turn 2020 into the best year of my life. I started eating better and exercising more, already lost nearly 17 kg so far, I started practising my social skills more, I made sure I got a promotion at work. But then, it all got turned upside down in a heartbeat.

This Corona pandemic has ruined everything. My biggest hobby, which is going to concerts, has now been taken away from me, paranoia within my family has risen to a point where the toxicity levels are at an all time high and now my grandmother, who is one of the only people I've ever felt close with, is in the hospital. Suffering from Corona with a very slim chance of survival.

The one time in my life where I actually got motivated, started bettering myself and was going to make my way out of depression and anxiety so that in the future, I wouldn't have to go through my entire life alone anymore, I could maybe get in a relationship without messing it up due to anxiety and make some connections with people. The one time I started getting a little better everything turned to shit. Just like it always seems to do. Now I've slid back into a depression that's possibly worse than ever before. It's like I've been destined to be taken down to the ground on every step my entire life. I know there's way bigger problems going on in the world right now, but this is just how I feel right now.

Today is a turning point, where I've lost the majority of my hope. It is now time to plan my next steps seriously. I pos this on the off chance my plan can provide someone guidance on the next steps of their life. And perhaps as an immutable record on the www. Maybe I am crying out to the world? Who knows?

I've been fighting to repair things with my wife for months after another traumatic event, the passing of my mum. In a short span I've lost my wife, my mum, my home, my future, my dreams and soon my childhood home as my dad sells the place.

I've done things wrong by my wife and was too ignorant and self absorbed to realise the signs. Even when she clearly pointed it out to me. I recognise its my fault now; I was too focused on what I thought she wanted and not what she told me she needed, and too lazy and dumb to carefully ponder her words. The best I can do now is to ensure that when I leave she is well cared for financially and that I've done all the things I've said I would to make her home perfect.

After this I will give away the majority of my things; there is no meaning to collecting things without having a home to store them or someone to share them with. Years of work and money wasted hoarding things for a future that will never see the light of day. Alas, fate and hindsight be a fickle beast.

Finally I will leave and volunteer in an impoverished nation to give someone a chance as happiness as penance for destroying my wife's happiness. Maybe I will die here from crime or illness. But at least I will have made a positive impact on someone. Who knows I might feel like I deserve happiness again.

What I will not do is leave without giving back to the world and balancing the scales. There is too much sadness in the world as it is. I have no hope for heaven but maybe this will absolve some of my sins.

I know this is selfish to my family, but my sis has her partner and my dad will have my sister. Sometimes we have to do what will bring us peace be it momentary or eternal.

I hope someone else find solace in the below excerpt of Dylan Thomas's famous poetry. The complete poetry isn't relevant to me but certain sections call out to my situation. It has given me and continues to give me strength in times of weakness, fighting for the courage to do good and remain hopeful as oppose to acting on my sucidal ideation.

""Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",Depression

I been told to get over past traumas, I would reply that I try too but somethings never changes.

Moral of the story is, I have what I need to be happy, yet I just feel utterally and totally useless and void of happiness.

I became addicted to escapism to the point where the very concept of video games are being burnt out for me. Art is starting to not be fun for me, making music is starting to not be fun for me. Everything that I used to do for fun is being burnt out.

Then there is the question of ""why not look for someone"". Simple answer, I am too mentally unstable for a relationship. It would take the worlds most patience person to understand and help me work through my problems without it affecting them. Plus I am terrible with people. 

When I was asked by I joined a league discord and joined a team and stuff, all I could say was. Because I was lonely. Not having people who wants to talk to you, or actually gives a shit about me for so long causes me to just be lonely.

Covid-19 Pandemic anxieties,2,g154ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g154ka/covid19_pandemic_anxieties/,0,1586898165.0,"Hello, 

I have never really been the type to be Depressed, I have always been a very optimistic and confident  guy. As of late with this whole Coronavirus pandemic i have been feeling the loss of interest in participating in society and maybe even being alive. This really spans from me being a classified an essential employee at a t-mobile store. I am thankful to be able to have a job because I know it is much better than not having one and I personally am taking the right precautions to stay safe.

However since my store reopened, most of the types of customers i have been seeing are people breaking quarantine because the are simply bored and want to be out and about. the question we get the most is  ""what kinds of deals do you guys have?"" 

This infuriates me because someone can just as easily look this up online without putting themselves or my co workers and I in danger. and for as long as there are people like that i dont see the situation getting any better.

I have also seen the better air quality and have read articles here and there about the atmosphere actually healing from the reduction of human activity.

Maybe humans are parasites despite our perceptions of ourselves. We are the only species that take and never give. we are literal maggots to this rotting earth. the more turmoil we go though, the less will i have to live. i feel like there is no point to anything at all. and i have never felt as suicidal as i do in these times",Depression

Around a week ago, I made a post on how I wanted to delete my memories and stuff because my life was cringe, and every action I make, I think it's cringe. I'm a gamer, but I restart video games often. I don't like the save files there. Even if I restart, I think it's still cringy, and I want to restart again! Plus, I have OCD hand washing problems. And I am autistic, so some of this may be dramatic. And I think that deleting my memories would be the perfect way to cure this ""mini-depression"" before it gets worse.

While I was a happy ""child"", and now in my teenage years, I'm a bit depressed, it might just get worse. I have a terrible attitude, and I've been trying to ""change"" it since July 2017, but it keeps getting worse. And with this STUPID COVID-19 existing, forcing me to use the confusing program known as ""Microsoft Teams"" instead of just going to my Special Needs class at my High School, I keep missing stuff, since I don't use my iPad that my schoolwork is on every day. And I could change that. But I won't.

And now, my stupid mother decided that I should ""heal my hands"", so she got rid of my soap and water. They may look terrible, but I'm gonna fucking die now. She doesn't know about how big this mistake is. And I could had avoided all of this bullshit this morning! But I didn't. Instead, I was stupid. I woke my mom up instead of using the other soap. I am so fucking useless. Now I have to limit my bathroom uses, because of her. You see, I had pee problems since I was 7. And no matter how many squares of Toilet Paper I use, pee goes on my hands just from WIPING it. My mom thinks I piss myself, when in reality, I don't. Pee just goes on my hands from wiping it. And I can't wash my hands off. So now my hands have to be dirty, and they'll smell like shit as well. All because of my fucking mother. I fucking hate her.

But, if I delete my memories, then I won't have to deal with any of this! Then I won't restart my games, and think it's ""Cringe"" when I first start them, since I won't remember playing them again! Then I won't know everything I touch will smell like shit since I won't be smelling my hands one-thousand fucking times in a few seconds. Then I'll be even more stupid as fuck, so then I can become smarter! Then, my body won't be stupid as well, and maybe it could reconnect to my brain again! AND THEN MAYBE I'LL FINALLY STOP MAKING CRINGY CHOICES, GET RID OF THIS DEPRESSION BEFORE IT STARTS, AND FINALLY BE A FUCKING GENIUS LIKE I WAS MENT TO BE! I HAD ENOUGH OF MY FUCKING LIFE! I NEED WAYS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MY MEMORIES RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

IF YOU TELL ME TO CHANGE, I WILL JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE, SINCE I'M A FUCKING STUPID CUNT WHO NEEDS HER MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE!

I AM FUCKING LOSING MY SANITY AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE!

I JUST WANT MY MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE AND PERISH FOREVER IN AN ABYSS THAT WILL SOON BE ERASED!

  I don't know where to begin. Life has been pretty rough lately, it has been for everyone. I've been working as much as possible so I don't lose my mind with everything that has happened within the past two months. The best conclusion I can currently come up with to make myself feel better is plan for the future. We hope (my household), with our stimulus checks, we can move out of the motel we're currently living in. Since I am also still working and receiving a paycheck, I intend to use this money towards fixing my teeth and getting a phone. I intend to help my best friend get her license and a car in the both of our names. Eventually, we're going to move out of state together. We can't figure out where yet, but that doesn't matter. We're making goals and we're planning and we're working and waiting. That's all we can do, right now.

 On a sadder note, I'm learning to not cry as often. Which doesn't sound sadder, by any means. But I kind of feel like it could be. Numb has always been worse because it just makes the days go faster, it doesn't take away that looming sense of doom in the back of my head. Or take your face away when I close my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I know I'll be okay. I just need to listen to 'I see a light' by Hank Williams on repeat and keep reminding myself what I need to do. If the harsh things I've been through have taught me anything, it's to learn to love and let go. And the best way I know how right now, is to just hope that someday, you'll be proud of me. That also keeps me going a little bit. That's what helps me accept what has happened. Instead of convincing myself I'm horrible and letting myself rot in my own little shell like I have so many times in the past before, once I started to, it woke me up.

I have some honestly incredible friends who I can normally talk this through with, but the stars are aligning in all the worst ways and they're all in terrible places, going through much worse shit than me at the moment. Last thing they need to hear is someone else's negativity right now. 

To keep it simple, for the last eight nights, I've been having panic attacks whenever I settle for bed and then nightmares. It's literally come out of nowhere. I'm no stranger to panic attacks, but I usually only get them in social situations, and nightmares haven't really bothered me much before. I haven't been able to sleep any more than three or fours hours each night, and on two nights, I've just given up and spent time on my computer mid-morning. 

I think it's just lots of little anxieties and worries building up, but the suddenness of it's floored me. I honestly don't know what to do. Been in touch with a doc about it via text (my university medical centre) and all I got back was a link to an online resource about improving your sleep hygiene. I guess the quarantine situation means I can't reasonably expect much on that front, which I understand and respect, but it still feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth. Country's facing some nightmarish shit at the moment but having no medical guidance for it doesn't put any smiles on my face.

I'm trying not to fall into a self-pity hole, but I was honestly not doing *too* bad until I woke up today. I was feeling shit all week, but rolling out of bed and socialising at least one friend each day to keep myself distracted. Today, I immediately just felt like a lemming as I opened my eyes, like I want to just go hurl myself off a bridge. I've got friends in a Discord call right now who I could go join, but I feel so groggy and snappy that socialising is starting to feel like a worse and worse idea the more I think about it.

my depression started when i became more conscious of myself. i hated how i looked. my mom has a habit of making passive aggressive comments. such as ""you're eating a lot lately"" ""looks like you put on some weight"" ""you're too skinny""  ""you should year make up to hide your acne"". i remember she would physically pin me down and pop my pimples, even when i resisted and cried. i don't remember exactly when but at some point a little before high school i decided to change how i dressed and looked. i had short hair since i was in 5th grade but now i cut in shorter. i wore baggier clothes. and i changed my name as well. i hated my name back then. she named me unity because i brought the family together.  it never felt that way when my dad and step dad left. i started smoking a lot of weed. i skipped most of my classes. i finished freshman hear with a GPA of 1.6 i think. i remember taking pain meds to get out of Spanish class. i started self harming that year too. i would even do it in class on occasion if i was feeling really bad. i wore hoodies everyday. i remember my step dad was the first to find out. he grabbed me and pulled up my sleeve. 

that was also the year i first attempted. it was a weak attempt. i took my mom's pain pills she got from knee surgery. i took whatever pills i could find. i was home alone that night. i took them. i felt so sick. i went and passed out in bed. i really hoped not to see tomorrow i tried 2 days before my 14th birthday. i did wake up, around 3 am i threw up a lot. it hurt so much. i didn't have the energy to clean it up. i went back to sleep. 

as i said before i was going through a point in my life where i changed my identity. so i was not wearing dresses or skirts. i had my best friend over. i don't know what we were doing. we were just hanging out in the room. my mom wanted us to wear skirts for some reason. when we refused she yelled at us the slammed the door locking us in. every time my mom raises her voice even to this day i jolt and cower. i hated my mom for how she yelled at my friend. if it was just me there it would have been fine. i'm used to her yelling at me. but why did she have to yell at my friend.  my friend never came over again.  she was my first real friend.  my mom blamed me for it. saying i should've just worn a skirt. 

later on my step dad lost his job. this ended up making my mom decide to move. meaning i would be leaving my best friend. we had moved many many times before but it got a lot hard in high school.  i cried the whole drive. she told us it was for our own good. we needed to be closer to family. it would be a fresh start. she never liked any of my friends anyway. she didn't like any of my choice and i do admit not all were good. 

my new school was nice. i luckily made friends quickly. this was my first indoor school. it was very interesting. the layout was easy understand. i was probably the happiest here. i was still depressed but i was better. i had an art class that i mostly enjoyed the teacher was at times strict. i made her cry because one of my pieces. it was a pretty emotional piece. she hung it up in the library.

As written in the title my girlfriend of two years is pregnant (19+3 ). And I hate everything about it, I don't want kids, especially not now or in the near future. I can't provide financially nor emotionally for a child, as I am still working on my degree. 
She has been on medication for her depression since ten years. One year after we got together she could stop taking her meds for the first time, last year she had to take them again.. - I struggle with a diagnosed dysthymia which got worse over the last year, including suicidal thoughts. 
I definetly do not want this child, I don't feel any  positive emotional connection to her pregnancy and told her from the first minute she announced it to me that I do NOT want this child. Our relationship struggled before the pregnancy,  she gave her puppy away which made me very angry as I felt that she did not think enough about getting the pup in the beginning ""I always wanted a dog"" yeah I could see that. The way she behaved and talked to me during this time was unacceptable for me - Not the situation where you want a child with that person.
I felt ignored of my feelings and thoughts about the pregnancy by her. All she said was "" I am sorry that you feel this way about it"". 
Seriously, I'd rather be dead than raise a child. Fast forward I had to leave to another country for my degree, now I can't return because of Corona. I don't even know if I want to honestly...
in the 14th week of the pregnancy she decided that she wanted an abortion, went to her gyn and the hospital, the hospital then told her that it is too late to legally terminate the pregnancy in our country. She now talked to her psychiatrist about the possibility to abort in a neighboring country "" An abortion that late would resolve in a livelong trauma"" sure, the birth of an unwanted child is not traumatizing /sarcasm off.

I just feel angry at her and more and more emtional distant from my side. Suicidal thoughts every single fucking day
Don't even know why I wrote this all down..propably the constant desperation.

Not coping well in quarantine & virtual dating/rejection,0,g15gnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g15gnv/not_coping_well_in_quarantine_virtual/,0,1586899465.0,"My (23f) job went remote 6 weeks ago. It was the only social contact I had. My coworkers and I weren't friends, but I was around people and didn't just stare at the wall all day. I miss hearing other people's voices so much. 

I live with my parents and we have a terrible relationship that makes me extremely lonely. My mom has slight agoraphobia so I was forced to stay inside my entire childhood. I'm getting triggered and am intensely lonely.

I've always used tinder but now have been using it obsessively. I'm not attractive but am photogenic. I got out of an abusive relationship this past year which has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I'm extremely self-conscious. 

I started talking to this one guy for a while through text/phone calls. He asked to videochat and I said ""I feel like you're not going to like me once you see me out of pictures."" (I had been snapchatting him and he definitely got pictures of my body. So he was aware of what my body looked like). But I'm carrying a lot of face weight that isn't shown in selfies and I have some acne and indents (which he knew about too). 

He assured me it wouldn't be an issue and he wanted to make me feel good about myself. He said we were a great fit emotionally and sexually (sexting). He found me attractive. So I agreed.

We videochatted and it went well. I enjoyed it and actually liked him more. Well, low and behold, he's instantly not into me anymore. I asked why and he wouldn't give me a reason even when I pressed. So naturally, we know what it is.

That gutted me. 

He was SO into me before. And then it instantly switched off for him.

Now my brain is going a million miles a minute. It's telling me that my abusive relationship was the best one I'll ever have. Which I've always believed. I mean honestly, that man is the only one who loved me for me. He cared about me more than my parents. He was my only friend for the last three years. I called him and asked to get back together. He said no.

I know I need to lose so much weight and get botox and make major improvements to my physical appearance in order to have anyone even consider liking me. But I also know that's not possible. I'm never going to lose this weight and I just don't have the money.

So now my brain is telling me I have to get used to the fact that I'll never have a boyfriend again, which means no husband/kids. I've never been successful with making friends. I'm trying to accept the fact that I will always be completely alone. And I just wish I could. I've been crying nonstop since Sunday. 

And I'm expected to work through all of this. I'm expected to be more productive than usual in order to keep my job. I literally can't even keep myself alive.

I hate saying, that everytime i am sad that means i am depressed. I never went to a psychiatrist, so i cannot say that i am depressed, because i was never diagnosed.

I dont want to be diagnosed that i am depressed, but i just want some answers, just to know how to deal with it and how to accept what i am feeling, i just dont know.

I made plans on how i would kill myself, a couple of plans, because when i go to bed, i start to think of a plan on how to kill myself, its just a thing my brain does most of the times i go to bed. I dont think that killing myself would be a bad thing, i feel such a weak person and also dont want to live, so why not leave this life and let others live it, who want to live, i just feel that i just take up space for people who want to live, for people who are trully happy. I just feel really weak and a coward on not just doing it. I thought about it for the last 13 years of my life, so maybe the time has come and i just need to do it, i just need to have some balls and just freaking kill myself. I just dont see the point of living if i dont want to, there are people who wants to live and dreams big and are happy, so i just want to give them the space for it. So maybe someone could explain to me am i depressed or maybe someone could be the person who would encourage me on killing myself?

How do you keep away from “bad” thoughts?,1,g156ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g156ix/how_do_you_keep_away_from_bad_thoughts/,1,1586898366.0,"TLDR: prolonged suicidal thoughts on my “bad” days, how do I stop from thinking about it too much?

To provide some background, I (34F) was sexually abused by my parents since I was 10 (continued until I was around 26, when I cut them off) and I was bullied during elementary school. Everyone always told me I’m too pessimistic, too negative, and cry too much. I suspected I had depression but never had psychiatric exams. Even when I was in elementary school, I had some thoughts like “I won’t have to be worried/scared/sad anymore if I die.” 

I went NC with my parents about 8 years ago, which is when I first met my husband (my then first boyfriend). My husband made me realize that my parents are toxic.  It’s interesting how I thought my parents were loving, good, “model” parents back then. The crazy thing is I still miss them sometimes.

Things got better after a while, I have a decent job that pays well and just bought a house this year. Despite all these “positives”, I still fantasize about sleeping forever or not exiting in this world. This especially happens when I have arguments with my husband. I guess you could say the only positive existence in my life is my husband (and my dog).

Whenever I “fight” with my husband, even though they are all small arguments, I feel like the world is not worth living and I constantly find myself looking up ways to end my life. I spend hours (usually for 3-8 hours at a time) reading about various methods of suicide that have/haven’t been successful. It came close the other day, when I was testing a belt on a wall hook to see if I could hang there for at least 10 mins without falling. But then I remembered reading about how hung corpses are gruesome and it’ll traumatize whoever finds the corpse, and I didn’t want my husband/dog going through that. 

I went to various therapists and psychiatrist before and they haven’t been that helpful. I’m tired of talking about my past at this point. I’m tired of crying. Husband still wants me to give it another try, possibly get on depression meds. Last time I took Zoloft, it didn’t seem to really help, but I can’t tell for sure since the doctor prescribed me a “pediatric” dose (I’m small).

How do I stop dwelling on suicidal thoughts? The world doesn’t seem that great and if it wasn’t for my husband, I’d probably just die.

I started taking prozac and I was on it for about three year before I stopped because I thought I was much better and didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately, the decision to do that was around the same time I decided to start going out and drinking alcohol (8 months ago), which proved to be the worst decision of my life. 

I had a crush on one of my friends for 2 years. I've been called ugly by people, including close friends(jokingly, but it still hurts), never had a girlfriend and have overall been subconscious about my appearance during my 21 years of life. Because of all that I didn't have any confidence in myself. I kept my feelings for her to myself for a year and a half.  I finally decided to tell her how I feel and she said she wasn't looking for anything right now and she would rather remain friends. I was okay with that but I noticed that she became more distant and a couple times I got drunk and drunk texted my feelings -- things I should never say that ended up jeopardizing our friendship. Through that we remain friends until three months ago I drunk texted her again and as a result she blocked me on every social media platform with no explanation. The thought of losing her completely kicked in and I was trying to force a reconciliation by messaging her friends, just trying to explain myself and not lose her because I really did cherished her as a friend. I mentioned hurting myself and not wanting to live. Two days later, I saw her on campus (its a small university), and I tried to talk to her, but she ran away from me and called campus PD, which led to me getting baker acted. 

My crush had always told me how much she loves and cares about me as a friend, how we'd always be friends no matter and how great of a person I am. So never in a million years would I think we would stop being friends. People always tell me that I'm the nicest, most thoughtful and caring person they know, but everyday I wake up and feel like I'm the worst person in the world. It has really been eating me up on the inside. I lost a friend because of the mistakes I made. IVE NEVER LOST A FRIEND BEFORE THIS. The same week of the incident, a couple mutual friends came up to me regarding the messages, which triggered my anxiety to a whole new level. I felt betrayed that the private messages I sent while intoxicated were exposed and now god knows how many people know about them. I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped going out, deleted social media and have isolated myself and I don't plan on going back. My anxiety has skyrocketed and I just have been avoiding everyone. (all of this was months before the pandemic).

I know everything I did is inexcusable and I guess this is a way of punishing myself for it. The suicidal ideation remain. I am embarrassed. I am regretful. I am remorseful. Even if she forgives in the future, I   wouldn't want her to see me again. I just want everyone to forget I exist and disappear.",Depression

I hated myself, thought constantly about dying, suffered from intense loneliness, thought I was unlovable, just wanted to disappear. Fortunately, I've never self harmed.

I've never been officially diagnosed. Never opened up about it when it was at its worst. Lived with it up through high school and into college. At some point in high school it got easier, I guess because I started making friends but I just seemed to be incapable of keeping friendships. I used to agonize over losing my friendships or having none at all but now I accept that it's the way life is. People come and go all the time.

At some point in college I finally started feeling better about myself, feeling confident, finally got a girlfriend. I felt like depression was behind me and I had the tools to fight it back if it ever reared its head again. But I never found motivation to do anything with my life.

In the last several years I've maintained a few close friendships because I've felt I don't need that many. But in the last year and a half I lost all of them from separate incidents and in some way I was to blame for each one. And then I broke up with my girlfriend because she wasn't putting any effort into our relationship. She developed feelings for someone else and realized she never had those feelings for me to begin with.

So now here I am, recently turned 30, feeling like I'm better off alone even though I really don't want to be, feeling like my life experiences have now proven to me beyond doubt I'll never belong anywhere or with anyone, people are probably better off without me, and I'm sad about it all but not soul-crushing sad like when I was a kid. I've begrudgingly accepted it. I don't feel numb. Just a sad sort of neutral. And I have no direction in life, nothing to live for. I don't really think about suicide. I feel like I'm just a leaf floating down the river of life, wanting to be more, wishing to have more, but knowing I probably never will. Just drifting along in life.

And I can't tell if I'm even depressed anymore. I've looked at some quick online tests but they're all like ""do you feel like life is pointless?"" ""Do you have thoughts of suicide?"" ""Do you feel sad all the time?"" They feel like the wrong questions. I feel like I might be depressed but it doesn't feel like the same kind of depression I've known my whole life.",Depression

I don't even know what I want to say.  I just feel like I need someone to talk to.  Cliche won't do.  What I'm feeling can't be wrapped up in that kind of package.  I like to be heard and felt and cliche is neither.  How can I be so damn lucky in life and still  have so many moments of misery?  I guess that is the nature of depression.  Anytime the pain lasts this long it is bound to happen.  What is weird is that we are in the middle of this damn quarantine and that isn't what is bothering me.  Everyone feels so alone right now and maybe that is what is the most depressing.  Nothing feels different to me.  Through either self-isolation or a lack of concern from friends I've been alone for a long time.  I can't include anyone in this.  Not really include them anyways.  I can tell them what I've been through with basic descriptions and labels.  I can say I've been hospitalized for depression.  I cannot and would not invite them into my world so that they could truly understand my feelings.  To understand this, one would have to empathetically sink a little into some very dark and uncomfortable feelings.  That is like asking someone to voluntarily join you in your nightmare.  I don't even want to be in my nightmare, I would never ask a loved one to come with me.  There are coping skills for this.  Things I am supposed to do that helps me ride out the storm.  They give you a boat and oars, tools to navigate these waters, but sometimes you can look right at the oars, feel the boat rocking under you and not have the will, energy, desire to take hold of the oars.  Sometimes the water looks like the right and only answer.  Just fall overboard and sink as far away as possible.  That is when you take the oars anyways.  Because you remember.  A child's face.  A distant memory.  Empathy for the pain of others.  Even good days when this feeling is almost forgotten.  Stroke.  My son's first crawl.  Stroke.  My wife's warm skin.  Stroke.  My daughters first dance.  Stroke.  I will laugh at something again.  Stroke.  I am strong enough.  Stroke.  There IS value in me.  STROKE.  THIS GOD FORSAKEN FEELING WILL NOT BEAT ME.  STROKE.  FUCK YOU PAIN.  STROKE.  STROKE.  I AM A FIGHTER.  A GLADIATOR.  STROKE!   STROKE!  STROKE!

"I have all of these horrible memories, and no one to talk to.",3,g0ycdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0ycdk/i_have_all_of_these_horrible_memories_and_no_one/,11,1586865234.0,"The situation is a little hard to explain, but I'll sum it up as fast as I can. I started dating someone in High School who had a lot of issues. They were heavily abused as a child and had just no understanding of normal- or how not to be violent. I stayed with this person. I saw the person behind the rage and I knew I liked them, but I was young. When I graduated I moved out to go to school in the same area he lived in. I moved in with him. He proceeded to destroy me. From my confidence to my self worth and my trust of other people. Piece by piece he picked me apart. He reduced me to numbness, to isolation.

But here's where things get a little more interesting.

About six years into our relationship, I told him I couldn't take it any more. After countless nights of sitting with him while he cried, coming home to find him half way off the balcony (We were 17 stories up), being screamed at for not doing the dishes, being yelled at for just not understanding, having things thrown at me and being kept up until 3am most nights when I worked a 6am-2pm job six days a week, I just could not take it. I told him I loved him, but if he could not go and get help and figure this shit out I was leaving. We had a huge fight, but the following day he asked me to make him a Doctor's appointment, because he was too afraid. He got anti-depressants. Things started to change.

It's been almost eight years since that fight. We are still together. He changed himself completely over that time. Went to therapy, got a handle on why he was treating people the way he did. It's been a couple of years since he had any major issues, and I am definitely much happier. I am very proud of how far he's come. The amount of work it took for him to get where he is and the battle he faces every day thanks to the things his awful family did to him is humbling. It offers a certain amount of comfort, knowing I was enough to change for. But there are a few issues.

I went through all of that with him. We have been together about 12 years in total and friends for over 16 years. I wasn't about to make him go through that horror all by himself. But in the process, I've done myself so much damage. I have horrific memories of that abuse, including the few times he got physical. His rage caused a lot of black outs, so he doesn't remember most of it (I need to make it clear, he does not use this as an excuse. He has owned up to everything I've told him about, and he knows there is more). The problem is more or less me. Every time I tell him about something, every time I tell him about a fight we had or a time he made me really uncomfortable, the guilt he feels is very clear. He tries hard not to get too down, because he knows I don;t enjoy making him sad, but he has a lot of regrets from that time.

The issue has become that I can't talk to him about it. This man has been through 13 years of physical, sexual, mental and emotional abuse. He has dealt with all of this once before. Coming back through it with me is just re-triggering things I don't ant to see him go through again. He's tried his best to be supportive, but between the fear I gained of communicating with him over the first part of our relationship and my concerns about his mental health, I can't talk to him. But over the course of helping him, I distanced myself from my friends and family to keep them safe and to better contain the situation. these people also do not know the extent of the things that happen and I don't want them to think about him that way. He really is a very mice person now, having worked hard to be that way. But knowing what he did, most people cannot look passed it.

I just don't know where to go from here. I have no one to talk to, but these memories are eating me alive. I've scared all the time and when I panic I get sucked back into those moments. He asks me what's wrong- I just can't tell him. I can't sleep, I barely eat because I feel ugly and I am constantly frustrated. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I have 2 herniated disks from the aforementioned full time work and I have a brain injury that causes extra mood swings and cognitive issues. He cares for me, he helps me and he keeps things clean. He tries, but I'm so wrapped up in the past I have a hard time even getting involved in our new relationship. I'm not sure what to do from here...

&#x200B;

Edit: I super appreciate all the support but I need to note for clarity and to avoid too many repeats: As stated above I am disabled and thus unable to work. I do not have any money and my partner is currently in education to get a decent career to support us. We live on about $1000 a month, plus food donations from family. So right now, I cannot afford therapy. We have considered both therapy for me, and couples therapy but cannot currently afford it. When he went through therapy I was fortunate enough to still be employed and had a decent benefits package that allowed for that for my spouse. I lost those benefits in 2015 when I was laid off from the job that allowed for those things, and at the time I Was dealing with his issues and so did not go through my own healing.",Depression

What about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.

A frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you wouldn't even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.

I (23F) have lots of friends (which I am grateful for) but I just don't feel close to any of them and I'm always scared they are going to abandon me. I was getting my sh\*t together but Corona time and being stuck at home had put me right back down. I've had many people abandoning me, hence the issues. I sometime find it funny to write them because there's just so much it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me or if I'm just cursed.

\-Back in the days when I was about 15, I got in a fight with my best friend at the time and she turned everyone against me so that I got kicked out of the group (At 15, those friends were my only friends) There were about 17 people in this group and I'm still friend with 3 of them.

\-My ex-boyfriend (worst thing that ever happen to me) broke up with me but kept telling me he loved me and wanted to come back with me for 2 years after the breakup when we had been dating for 1 year only. Being young, dumb and in love I waited but he was just using me.

\-I moved to another country quite far and the girl that I considered my best friend told me after a bit that I was downgraded to just a friend.

\-My best friend of 2 years told me he had feelings for me and didn't want me around because he was scared he would do something he'd regret, he also had depression but I couldn't help him since he did not want me around. He pretty much broke up with me at that point. 4 month after while on a road trip with 6 friends he snapped and yelled at me telling me the last good memory he had with me was from 1.5 year prior. I had no idea he was resenting me that much until he said so. 

\-My other ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks after my best friend did the same and told me after 1 year of dating that he never loved me and was waiting for feeling to develop but it never did. 

My best friend and my boyfriend both broke up with me within 2 weeks so did not have a lot of people I could talk to.

Add on top of that my family problems because I still live at home with both my parents, my university problems since I can't seem to be able to focus and do enough work, the fact that I can not climb anymore (my passion and stress relief activity) and you get a good idea while I'm feeling this way

Ever since learning about it and becoming diagnosed with it by my local health department, I have progressively debilitating memory, my ability to do basic responsibilities (taking care of the family pets, brushing my teeth) has become hellishly hard, and to my surprise, I have lost myself in this dark, but strangely comforting abyss.

I have been taking Wellbutrin (150mg) for about a month or longer, sometimes missing days and sometimes even with the knowledge that I need to take them by getting out of the bed, forget about it entirely. Initially when getting into antidepressants, my mother noted my eyes were clear, and I was more lively.

But now...I feel as if I have slowly faultered off it's effectiveness. Though it made me periodically happy, it never got me to the point where I wanted to take action in life. Really, nothing changed.

My entire decision on taking Wellbutrin over other depressants was to conserve a source of energy I have plenty of - sexual. Reading on Reddit and especially doing the research, I found that most SSRIs kill libido, which though not very sexually active with others, is a high driving force that I've yet to control.

Sometimes spikes of energy hit me enough to get a little bit done, but at the most inconvenient times (the sudden invigoration to clean out my whole closet at bedtime).

But despite all this, I have become selfish and irrationally jealous and angry at the success of people who seem to have everything together. I know they don't, but they act so well like they do. I dream of the day where I can draw and write of a quality that yawns a jaw wide, dream to feel sexy and wanted, dream to feel love. I have a family that cares about me, but I don't feel that except for my mother. I have several people on my friend's list and yet I feel completely alone. 

I have completely secluded myself from Twitter from artists I enjoy because I am now jealous that the beauty they create completely squanders any characters, worlds, ideas or more that I could ever create. I am weeks behind on class work at my college. I have never felt so powerless. I even - without conscious thought, bought a BB gun to practice overcoming the fear of death. I bought pellets and metal targets to persuade my parents into thinking I wanted to pass the time, but the purpose and practice of me fingergunning my head, into my mouth or under the chin had and still is a constant pastime.

Depression is piloting me into hell, and I just don't know where to start. Journaling feels seldom an idea that works, people say they are there for me to talk to, but I never can get the words out or I feel they would never understand.

Anytime anyone says everything will be alright, I feel myself go semi-ballistic. Anytime anyone asks too many questions that are of the same caliber just differently worded, the same happens. I lash out verbally, often.

I created this account not as a pity party or to be babied. But as a way to get a direct answer and order to follow so that I can push myself to remember who I am, to condition myself to never be jealous or envious of the art around me and realize I can make something just as beautiful, and how to condition and steel myself to deal with moments like this where I could crash again. I don't want that anymore.

How do I find out who I am? How do I decide jealousy from my system? How do I prevent this from happening at the magnitude that it is, again?",Depression

The worst part of me is having mental breakdowns regularly - when this happens, I cry with no reason for a long time and need some gentle support.

So yesterday night the breakdown came and I couldn't fall asleep till 5AM. When I told my bf in the morning about my trouble night he got frustrated. He asked me if I ever think about him doing such things - by that he meant not sleeping, crying and feeling depressed. 

He also told me that I'm giving up and do nothing do fight the depression. Yeah, I can't do much at the time - due to pandemics I cannot go to therapy. I also feel so senseless that any fight isn't worth effort for me, to be honest.

So due to his frustration I promised him to pretend that everything is fine. This thing gives me many difficult feelings, like the feeling that I won't longer be able to be my true self to him. Or the feeling that I've lost the only person I could rely on hard times.",Depression

I am always finding ways to escape this constant feeling of sadness, but it always catches up. Sometimes you have the will to fight it, but when everything you try and do fails or makes things worse, I reluctantly start to thing it is best to do nothing. But doing nothing doesn't help either. There is no winning.

It has come to a point where when I see happiness from something as simple as enjoying an ice-cream to joy from affection, I am jealous of it. Jealous and sad because I know I cannot feel that happiness.

Around 2 years back i was a very happy person and out of the blue my mind just went completely blank. I couldn’t talk to people because there was nothing in my mind and as a result I became very anxious and insecure. I skipped a lot of school and found myself becoming an emotional person out of nowhere. I was crying at movies and stuff like that. I was honestly confused more than anything as to why I was feeling this way and I kept trying to write it off as an off day but this lasted maybe ~5 months. 

I found some ways to deal with it so I wasn’t as hopeless but I still felt happy at times throughout those months and I still do now and I don’t know if what I think is “depression” is just a natural circumstantial emotional response. For instance I really don’t like myself but it’s just because I do things that are annoying, so is my low self esteem just a natural product of that instead of me having depression? Like if I was very likable and was popular and pretty I don’t think I’d be “depressed”. I’ve also self harmed a couple of times but I think deep inside I was doing it for some kind of attention or as a confirmation that I have actual depression and I’m not just a loser, and I get urges to self harm whenever I feel overwhelmed but I don’t know if I’m subconsciously wanting to do that for attention because I know there’s other ways to cope.

Terror,2,g10d3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g10d3g/terror/,0,1586874495.0,"I want to leave something behind, but I can’t seem to begin to build anything. I want to love, but I can’t be loved back—not wholly, not unconditionally, the way I want to love.

I used to not care, but only recently, I learned what it means to give a damn about yourself. I almost wish I hadn’t come to that realization. It forces me to see that almost everyone else begins with this condition—knowing intuitively it is not only acceptable but perhaps even imperative to love the self. In the grand scheme, it is perhaps both inconsequential and myopic to obsess over such trivial matters; but I’ve chosen to disregard this truth as a result of the aforementioned realization.

I learned someone loved me, but they can’t fully love me, at least not now, at least not without consequences. It would be a disaster, but I pray for that disaster to materialize. The mere thought of building a new life from the scattered debris of a ravaged tower is perhaps a delusion, but that delusion is all I have; so I cling to it, even if it makes me appear a desperate, lonely madman, which is what I must confess I have recently been reduced to.

She has her obligation, which I understood from the beginning, something I never thought she or I could overcome—until recently, when she and I became closer then I ever could have imagined. I’ll remain distant, I bargained, until the storm passes, if it passes at all; but I was warned maintaining such distance as a matter of volition was an impossibility, at which point I resigned myself to the contemptible verity that I am merely a laborer of my own mind’s undiscerning whims.

How does one break free under such conditions? Once again surrender to that ever-encroaching pit of stagnation? Pray for the annihilation of that which will never be broken? Or battle through the biological impulse to remain alive for the benefit of all who secretly despise you?

I don’t want to think about where she is now. I don’t want to think about where she will be tomorrow. Yet when she’s with me, such terror dissipates. Perhaps it is yet another delusion of mine to believe that the terror will not again return.",Depression

I was put down by the counselor being  condescending. Through walking that hall all I wanted was Mr.C to be there. I wanted him to comfort me and tell me everything was going to be alright. I looked down as I cried when all of a sudden I see Mr.C turning the corner. I became shy and anxious. I remember him noticing me crying. He said ""How are you""in a sympathetic voice. I managed to mumble out a broken ""good"" as I swiftly walked past him. He said ""good, that's great"" and walked past me. That was it. No comfort, no acknowledgement, nothing. I walked to my class and he continued on his way. I wonder if he ever looked back. If he ever cared to ask me what was really wrong. Last year he got engaged. I was happy for him but jealous.

I didnt start taking treatment seriously until I was 20. This year I turn 22. My psychiatrist explained to me that because I had gone for so long without treatment, my brain has essentially rewired itself to insufficiently process reward chemicals, and that I would need to take medication for potentially multiple years before going back to normal. She said that, perhaps, I never could go back to normal.

Quite frankly, it's been so long that ""normal"" for me feels like being depressed.

It took time for me to experiment around with different medications and dosages until I found the pairing that really helped (Welbutrin 300mg and Zoloft 100mg if you're curious.) When I start taking the medication, I start feeling great after about a month. That terrible feeling in my chest is gone. My suicidal thoughts are suppressed. It feels like I can actually talk to other people.

But every time... after about 3 months or so, I start feeling like I'm not myself anymore. I feel like the medication took apart of me away. Almost like being depressed is a part of who I am. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they told me I'm stupid for feeling that way. Am I actually stupid? Am I alone in this feeling?

It feels cathartic to be depressed and to cry and cut myself. Everytime I start up my medication, i have to resist the urge to stop. Before I'd started taking again, I told my psychiatrist how I felt, and all she said was that I need to fight the urge to stop. She explain that the more times I stop and start the medication, the less effective it will be the next time. And if I keep this cycle up, I may cause irreparable damage to my brain's reward system.

I'm fighting the urge again. I'm starting to miss feeling hopeless and miserable. And in a way, I feel hopeless and miserable not feeling that way anymore.

Anything I post on my social media accounts are completely ignored by everyone. I have no one to talk to. I feel like no one gives a shit. My best friend is in a different state and super bad at texting, so having an actual conversation with her is pretty much impossible these days, I've never had the kind of relationship with my parents to where I feel comfortable talking to them about anything really, I'm not in school and I have extreme social anxiety so I have no way of meeting people my age, and making online friends has always felt weird to me, I get along with my coworkers but I don't know them well enough to confide in them and I'm too scared to try and get close to them, and talking to my therapist just isn't the same as having a friend. I'll probably never date because guys have never liked me, and no one would ever be able to put up with me. I've never even had a real relationship so I don't know how to. And like I said, there's really no way to meet people my age here, and dating apps scare me, not to mention they're only for hookups and I hate hook up culture. So basically that's why I'm here. I literally have nowhere else to get everything off my chest and I feel like it's killing me. This is probably going to be pretty long so I'll be shocked if anyone actually reads through it all.

I'm 20(f), turning 21 soon. I went to college for a year before dropping out, and shortly after my family moved to a new state. I thought it would be a fresh start, but instead I'm cut off from everything I ever knew. I got my first job last summer, it pays well, but the living cost where I am is ridiculous, so I can't afford to move out. I have no real skills and have a difficult time completing/understanding the simplest tasks, so I know I'll never be able to have any job other than minimum wage service industry, and I absolutely would not be able to handle the stress of a second job. Because of that, I'm afraid I'll never be able to move out. I can't afford to move out on my own, and finding a roommate seems impossible. You have to pay for every single roommate finding app/website, and like I said, I have social anxiety, so I'd have to know someone extremely well to be able to live with them. I'm also a more conservative person, and every person my age, (especially in my area) smokes weed, drinks waaay too much, and is very aggressive about politics (I don't like talking about politics to anyone, not even people I trust). I also have no credit score, and no renters history, so idk how I'd get an apartment even if I could find a roommate. 

Living with my parents is becoming a living hell. They treat me like a child, and always have. They don't listen to a single thing I say, they don't understand me, my depression and anxiety, or even really seem to try to. I haven't been able to grow up because they won't let me. I pretty much don't know how to do anything myself, and I can't ask them for help because they tell me I should teach myself, which I've never been able to teach myself anything. I did my taxes for the first time this year and they had to walk me through it. I can't budget. I don't understand the stock market, or credit scores, or anything at all to do with money. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety because Idk what to buy. I'll be covered by their insurance till I'm 25, but I have no idea what I'll do when that happens because Idk how to go about choosing insurance plans/companies. I have a hard time making appointments for myself because talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety. I don't know anything about politics. Trying to learn any of this is just so overwhelming I can't handle it and I just shut down. So basically I am actually just a fucking child and there's not a single thing I know how to do.

How could there possibly be a future for me?

I don't know how I can have any kind of life worth living. I feel like I'll be living in my tiny bedroom in my parents house, single with no friends until I die. I feel so pathetic.

Unemployed 

Family?
Too depressed to care for them

Education?
 7 years of my life “trying” to get a degree, but just wasting money

Friends?
Almost everyone is gone, I don’t know if I drove them away or they just weren’t my friends all along

Mental state?
Trying to ignore having depression with weed  


I just don’t know what’s going on, I just feel that people hate me for no reason which makes me get away from them. 

I just want to be alone.

I know I need help but I just can’t ask for it.
Why? When I was a kid my parents “taught” me to never ask for help, and I know that this is not a valid excuse but I just don’t know how or care enough to change 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I just don’t have some to talk to, and even if there was someone, I would be too afraid to talk.",Depression

i met this girl in sixth grade. well, more like I got a crush on her but I never got the guts to talk to her. after a semester I had to move to a different middle school in the same district so I thought I’d never see her again but for some reason I still held out hope. 

time passes and high school comes around. it’s 9th grade and I’m in English class, talking to acquaintances, when I see her. long story short I get her Snapchat and we become friends. hooray. after a few good months of being friends I confessed to her. we got into the talking stage and I was so happy... maybe too happy. me being a 14-year-old who barely knew how relationships worked I was far too clingy and after about 3 months she broke it up and started dating someone else. I felt awfully because it felt as if I had been cheated on but after some time I realized why she would have done that.. we stopped talking for a while. 

Sophomore year came around and after a good 5 months of self deprecating I was slightly confident that things would turn around. wouldn’t you know it, she’s in my Gov class. we didn’t talk right away, but it was so painful seeing her and then seeing them together. one day I get a text from a random number asking who i was. I return the question. it’s her. for some reason i was okay with being friends. honestly, i had those feelings for her and after not being able to take it anymore, I confessed to her. obviously she was in a relationship so nothing happened. but those were a good 3 months of friendship. 

after a few months of crying myself to sleep, summer finally comes around and I start working a bit on myself. talking to girls. junior year came around and I was feeling okay for the first time in a long time. until I walk into my algebra 2 class and she’s there. I go to my lunch and I see her. a few months later I get a Twitter dm. it was her. she wanted to see how I was. we talked for quite a bit and became friends again. I still had most of those feeling but accepted she was in a relationship so I tried to not pay them attention. anyways, after around 2 months her boyfriend finds out about us (he knew about our ‘history’) and told her to stop talking to me. so we did. about a month or two pass and we talk again. I can’t remember how, exactly. anyways, he finds out and breaks up with her. she blames me for it and we stop talking. a few days later she texts me saying how they got back together. she keeps on saying it’s ‘toxic’ but she wants to be with him. anyways, we stop talking for a good while. this was like November (I think) and she texted me on the holidays to wish me happy holidays. January comes and she says how they broke up. he had cheated on her. we talk for a few days and I realize I gotta act on my feelings so I do and I confess. after talking it out we realize we both want to make it work out so we do. we are on the talking stage again and it’s all good for a few weeks. until she tells me she’s been hanging out with him. I ask her to please stop because not only do I feel uncomfortable with that, but he has brought so much misery into my life. she refuses, so I end things. a couple of weeks pass and she texts me. saying how she apologizes and wants to make work things work out again. I told her I’d be okay with that as long as she’ll stop talking to him. she says no, which was a huge red flag that I ignore. for some reason, perhaps out of fear of being lonely again, I tell her as long as they don’t hang out or talk *constantly*. we go for a few weeks and it’s really great. until she tells me he was going to go pick her up. it was like 11pm. I told her to please not go but she said it was okay. after a night of feeling miserable I woke up and waited for her to be up. when she was, I asked her how it went. she told me they kissed. I ended things right there and then. 

Last week I was texted her at around midnight. I had received a text from her that apparently was delayed a few weeks so I asked what was going on. we talk about everything that has happened between and somehow we both still want it to work out. I tell her again that she can’t hang out w him if she wants to try again but she says she can’t because now he’s in her friend group. I ask her that then she just doesn’t talk to him and then she says she won’t do anything. that apparently I’m the person she wants. she tells me that maybe we shouldn’t start anything right away because she needs some time. I tell her I’m okay with waiting for her (I wasn’t). one day in the morning she texted me the image of a pregnancy test with a faint second line asking me if there was a second line. I immediately ask her if she had sex and she tells me she did ... this is during this whole quarantine thing so I haven’t seen her in weeks. she doesn’t tell me who it was but I’m pretty sure who it was. anyways, we stop talking. 

today I was going to walk my dog as I usually do when I see the two of them by my house (she knows where I live) and I almost broke down crying. why? why does this have to happen to me? I think I was talking to her out of fear of losing her and being lonely but i don’t know. I’m just usually so lonely. I’ve tried talking to other girls and things just never work out. I do have friends and my family situation is okay but this kind of stuff breaks me, especially because of my age and how much importance there is in these kinds of things. I don’t know what to do, honestly.",Depression

For every good there was a bad. I talked about it with friends and they have always told me ""That's Life"". It was really frustrating.

Eventually, I got to the conclusion that if there was no good in my life then there must be no bad. I have family issues at home and I started ignoring them. At the beginning this mentality worked, but now I've gotten into a point of no return.

I feel I can't be physically happy anymore, I have such a negative mindset that I try desperately to change but can't. I only find comfort in video games and series, but for reasons relating my family's view on these hobbies, they have been restricted too.

I'm in a hole I can't escape and I feel trapped, and the corona virus is not helping either, locking me with my parents forcing me to handle their problems. It is really frustrating and I do not know what to do, I desperately want a change in my life. I want to be happy but I can't, it is so emotionally draining...

I am 29 yr old straight male.

About me:

I   have always exceptionally done well when it came to education,  hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme  INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters  here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working  well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling  that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really  appreciate any help. I  need some \_/\\\_.

Here's what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -

2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had

2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.

2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design

2015   - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence  kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to  make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started  smoking as  well regularly

2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.

This continued slowly until I graduated and moved

2017   - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, didn't work  out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would  stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started  living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they  were  toxic.

2018 - My sexual   frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just   liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do   anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess   it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated   because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I   felt stuck.

2019 -  Met a girl   through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all   wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of   surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at   them as well.

2020 Jan -  This   year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found   out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex   boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.

Feb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.

Mar   - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a   guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses and threatened to put all her cheating texts online.

1 week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf   in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it  I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,   where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And   none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.

I   made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started   working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex   even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of   such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started   apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I   tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona   outbreak.

Last week - she   contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She   did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told   me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow  I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her  life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able  to  move ahead.

I feel like I have  hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am  locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and  just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side  rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my  feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I  feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I don't feel  like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of  abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and  scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me  but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.

Thank you, and sorry for long post. \_/\\\_",Depression

I cut myself a lot sometimes daily, drink, have suicidal thoughts, little to no energy all the time, have trouble in school and socializing, and my home life I don't know if it's abusive or not but it definitely isn't good.  My friend once said after I made a suicide joke ""ew you legit sound like a 14yr old girl"" and I've just been thinking a lot about how maybe I'm not depressed and just an overreacting or attention seeking teen. I feel like all my friends hate me and I'm just annoying to them. I'm scared if failure and stress everyday about what I'm going to do for my future and how I'm going to make it. My parents divorced when I was 9 and both of them got cancer around the same time leaving me pretty much free at both houses because my 5 siblings either just never talked to me or were at collage and my grades started improving and I made some online friends because I didn't realize how much my parents try to control me and push their views onto me until now. I also realized neither of them give a shit about me as a person but just want me to be there so there and do everything for them. I don't like venting to my friends because I just feel like I'm annoying them but sometimes when I hit a low I do so anyway and when I come out of it I just feel really bad for venting to them. I've tried suicide twice by hanging myself but both times the object I was using to hang myself from the ceiling broke or felldown. There's a lot more problems I could talk forever about but I don't feel like my problems are bad enough for me to be feeling suicidal and I feel like I'm too young to be thinking life is hopeless and to be having frequent breakdowns.

To sum up: I'm very depressed and self harm and drink and that stuff but feel like I shouldn't be having these thoughts because of how young I am and feel like my life hasn't been bad enough for me to feel this way

My relationship with my father has been horrible for most of my life, but recently it's gotten worse to the point that I don't even try to connect with him or talk to him at all if I don't have to. Even that is too much of a bother to him, though; a few days ago I overheard him complaining to my stepmom that I keep talking to him, saying that I'm annoying and am always trying to get his attention and interrupt his games, and telling her how disrespectful it is that I talk while he has headphones on (for the record, all I say is ""Hey, Dad!"").

You know what I dared inconvenience him with?

I was taking the dog for a walk since she hadn't been out all morning, and he had her in his office.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There are days on end where we don't talk at all, and I bother him too much?! It's completely ridiculous. I can't believe I was stupid enough to move back in here, but now I can't leave because the rent went up too much for him to pay on his own when he moved, and my stepmother and brother can't make up the difference, and even if I knew they were okay, I have no money saved up and I barely make enough to even afford to rent a room somewhere.

This is something I've been dealing with all my life, from him, my mom, and my stepmom (although she's genuinely changed and we're on good terms now, as a child she was my worst nightmare). I have trouble making or keeping friendships because I feel like nobody wants me around or really cares. I don't know what to do to fix my life. I have no real friends, I have a job that I don't feel like I'm good at or can succeed in, and I'm in an environment that is horrible for my mental health but that I can't afford to leave.

Husband was next to me asleep like usual. He never hears her cry at night. I soothe her, go back to bed. Can't sleep. This has been my life for the last few months. I am exhausted but can't sleep. During the day I can barely keep my eyes open. During the day I am working from home like  most people are during this pandemic. When I try to take a nap, there is too much noise going on so can't really get a solid nap in either if I do fall asleep. 

On top of that, I have several things I have been dealing with: 

\- I have depression for which I take antidepressants. These antidepressants give me the side effect of dilating one pupil more than the other and causes me headaches. I wear glasses to help combat the headache. I can't really stop taking the antidepressants cause you should never go cold turkey on them. 

\- I've also been having a thyroid issue. It's enlarged and will need to be partly removed in June (hopefully, if it doesn't get canceled due to Corona). I've been feeling like I'm going through menopause: Sweating, hot flashes, emotional, ... I'm 28 years old ... 

\- Got scoliosis and kyphosis. Used to go to the chiropractor for treatment but since the pandemic I can't and I've been having muscle spasms and pretty bad back pain. 

\- My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer spread to the liver and peritoneum. She got her 5th chemo a week ago. She's doing well but we're currently not speaking of her being cured or being able to have the operation to remove the ovaries and cancer. 

\- My husband has PTSD (Army veteran) and has depression. Takes antidepressants as well as I do. No side effects luckily but he's usually quite negative, easily discouraged and likes to game all day every day if I let him. He moved to my country with me and the daughter for a better life and his integration program has been postponed due to Corona. He's not happy having to wait, he wants to work so bad. 

This pandemic has me worried. I am always super careful, keep my distance, wear gloves, wear a mask, wash my hands when I come in and use handsanitizer, immediately shower right after coming back and then I allow myself to go say hi to my mom and my daughter (we all live in the same household btw). I am terrified ... What if I picked up the virus but don't know, what if I give it to my mom with stage 4 cancer, what if I give it to my daughter or my husband. I don't know if my mom would survive it in her condition ... So much anxiety ... 

I would love to hear some tips and tricks on how to be able to get some sleep and calm myself down enough so I don't go absolutely insane. 2020 has been awful so far and I am expecting to see the 4 horsemen and Cthulhu this year at this point. Thank you guys for reading!

TLDR: 28 year old with depression, antidepressants causing pupil issues and headaches, thyroid issues, scoliosis and kyphosis, my mom with stage 4 cancer, an 18 month old and an immigrant stay-at-home husband with PTSD would like some advice on how to be able to finally get some well needed sleep!",Depression

I finally started saving up to move into my own place, finally looking for a career, finally about to actually graduate instead of walking on a stage. 

Instead, now I’m staying at home wondering when I’ll ever be able to see another face again. I’m stuck worrying if my parents are going to be okay not just financially but also health wise. I say I’m going to keep reading, learning how to code, yatta yatta... but it all just bores me now after a few minutes.

I can never seem to describe how I feel without feeling gross and I believe this is down to how my parents would react if they found out about how I’ve been struggling.

I’ve been doing online therapy for the past 3 months and it’s honestly barely helped because I can’t bring myself to use it regularly or use the helping tools. My parents aren’t aware of this - although I’ve hinted that I do therapy to my mom but she doesn’t often pay interest. I’m at a point now where I don’t even want to help myself to stop the negative impact I have on those around me - it’s beyond selfish, and I’m beyond caring.

I don't know why I was even in a relationship with him again in the first place after all the different times he left me for someone else. I guess it's because people like him find insecure people like me and just plant themselves in our heads. 
I have worked at the same place for over three years and over time got to know a guy there. I never (tried) to think anything of him to begin with, but I think people knew I felt something for him anyways. I'm not very good at hiding my bashfulness. He seemed to be everything I wanted out of a person.
Things were not going well in the relationship I was in. I was duped yet again, he wasn't going to change. He said he got a coworker's number just to see if he still had game, quit the job I got him, constantly belittled me in his ""subtle"" ways. I was fully convinced I was going to commit to breaking up with him. I wanted to talk to the coworker so badly that night, and my alcoholism helped out with that. Called him, told him how I felt and that I was going to dump the ex the next morning. 
But I didn't. That's most definitely where the conversation began but he threw a tantrum and ""tried"" leaving without his stuff. In hindsight I see I was being manipulated but when I tried to calm him down and he started bawling about how he wanted to marry me, I felt horrible and like I was about to throw away everything for someone I've never been with. Who might just leave me high and dry after a hookup. I let my insecurities be fed and stayed with ex for a little konger. I told my coworker after work the next day.... he didn't seem upset, he gave me a hug and told me he understood. But then he seemed.... different. 
I broke up with ex for good after I found out something disgusting he said to my sister and how he stole another sister's ear pods. Hurting my sisters drew the line for me.
And I went to the coworker, he just wanted to stay friends and he would hang out with me and my friends for the next few months occassionally. A few months ago we were still texting sometimes and joking around. But, knowing I hurt him still haunts me. I've never done anything like that before and it was the shittiest thing I'd ever done to the person I didn't know I was going to hurt. I still cry about it and feel selfish for hoping he'll forgive me someday and want to try again. I try to escape thinking about him but I can't.

First of all, nobody would believe the fact I killed myself, and they would wonder why. Normally, I look like a normal person outside since I would not express myself a lot to other people. I might leave my family and my friends and they would be sad and depressed and now that would cause more and more and more never ending problems. You see you are being controlled by this world this hell like society forcing you to do things you don’t like and brainwashing you. But there is also another thing that is torturing you, it belongs to you but somehow you cannot control it. It is your feelings, you might wonder, why? Here, let me explain, so look at why you wont kill yourself since it is because the society brainwashed you saying that it is bad and cowardly, and by leaving your family behind and feelings will make you *feel* guilty. The reason you didn’t do the things you love is because this society and the devil feelings is controlling you right now. Everything you know, everything you say is controlled by feelings and society. So lets look at this shit at the other angle. What if, you just got cancer, out of nowhere, it happened and you would die. That would be great but that is where feelings would come in and start torturing you. You wouldn’t want to leave your family behind but you wanted to die which in this scenario it have accomplished your dreams for you. But sometimes a person’s feelings is an angel to them they would do anything to make themselves happy. Now that is where society comes in and starts torturing them. Wanna know why? Here, since they would do anything to fill their joy and if an *angel feeling* person killed themselves since they wouldn’t think too much and that will lead to trouble for people around him. Sounds bad right, it sounds bad because society brainwashed you. It wants you to think the way that you weren’t supposed to think. Why is life hard, it is because of the modern society and depression is becoming more common and more common because of all these shit. The feelings, the stress, the people are all because of this society. Why would your feelings become a devil trying to make you think the other way. You were born in this horrible society, it is how it worked when you were born. And fuck it, fuck this society, fuck this world, fuck everything I own, fuck you god, why would this happen to us at this specific time. Why would these rare angel feelings exist, maybe some people think the other way, for some reason, these people think the other way when they are born. Or, maybe they developed other things living here in this hell but really rare. It matters the most about how you wanted to think and this world controls that. It is making you depressed and it is making us bad. Well, at the end of this long crap which might be bad, I hope you would find yourself a better future, and think that the reason of living is not because of money since the society is like that, the society make life worth money and a lot of people including me wants to end it.

Anger gone out of hand,1,g0zzzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0zzzb/anger_gone_out_of_hand/,1,1586872704.0,"Suffering with depression for the past 4-5 years and I've had help on and off.

One of the worst symptoms I think I experience is irritability and anger. It is just out of hand at this point. 

I mainly divert my anger towardd my family and never my friends or strangers or classmates. 

But I lash out terribly at them , especially my mom. My poor mom. It gets rough sometimes, and it really only just starts with me back talking. Which will then result in her talking back to me sometimes and then I will completely lose my shit, and just shout or swear. 

I dont ever usually yell any insults directed towards her, I will usually just mindlessly yell about my anger, or sometimes I will yell at her blaming her for how I am now, or yell at her over a stupid argument over something like a cup, etc.. alongside that, if I am in a bad mood I will just snap back at her my response instead of responding like a civilized person.

I feel bad, but In the moment I do not always feel bad. I have a hard time finding a healthy outlet for my thoughts so i personally believe that it comes expressed through aggression.

It is usually that I am sensitive and I just pick fights with everyone in the house. 

Its terrible because I know I'm being a pain in the ass, but it's worse because I dont have it under control and im putting people I care about under unacceptable remarks and a bitchy attitude all because I had a bad day.

Is this something meant for anger management?
Are there any mechanisms that can get me to stop myself before I lash out? To recognize that there are innocent people I deeply care about in front of me and that I shouldn't act that way towards them? I can feel my rage unnecessarily build up in the moment and then before I know it, it unleashes on everyone.",Depression

I don’t want to tell the world how I had fight my thoughts but what I want to show the world how I made it out and now that I’m at top, no one can stop me anymore.

I know everyone on the thread wants to share the story of what is bothering them but we are going to tell the world how we made it to top!! 

I have made myself a realistic routine and set of goals that can be achieved and set me on a path to greatness! I am open to share everything with whoever is interested and I hope you also join me on my journey and get yourself out like how I will!! 

Thank you and have an awesome day!!",Depression
I [M 21] have depression that started 1.5 months into my relationship with my girlfriend [F 18] and I fear I'm falling out of love.,3,g0sze7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0sze7/i_m_21_have_depression_that_started_15_months/,8,1586845132.0,"Sorry. This is a crosspost from RA but since no one responded in two hours I thought this might be a better place to ask... sorry!



Hello there,

Around the beginning of March, toward one of the nights, I was hanging out with my girlfriend and a friend, when suddenly a wall of anxiety hit me. (Do I love her? Should I break up with her??) Out of nowhere. I've never had a problem like this before. We talked about it, she said she wasn't really sure. She said she'd support me no matter what, I've started medication and started seeing a therapist. She's the most caring and kind person I've ever met, she's meeting my every need, and she's doing everything she can to make sure I know she loves me and she supports my journey. We are long distance unfortuntately, which isn't the end goal, but, important to mention, we want to meet and go on a date in August.

It feels like there's a part of me that's convinced I don't love her at all, and that I should break it off to save her the pain. But I don't want to, it's a sort of internal conflict. I legitimately cannot tell if I'm falling out of love or if I'm just dealing with depression and the remnants of being quickly and harshly dumped by my previous girlfriends. (Probably has something to do with it) I'm so desperate to stay with her and support her and yet it feels like every time we're just talking, and I have a thought like ""you don't love her"" it's all i can think about for the next couple hours. It's no doubt taking a toll on our relationship which is why I want to fix it so badly. I've never wanted to be fixed for anyone before. She is worth it. But I'm so terrified I'm in denial, sometimes we talk but I can't feel anything for her, then my anxiety kicks up to convince me I don't love her. It's terrifying. Everything triggers fear.

The reason I'm making this post is because last night I nearly had a breakdown at my own thought process. She asked me, as a thought exercise, if she thought ""the thought of her with someone else upsets me, or losing her upsets me"" and it didn't, in that moment. Which made me feel like complete and utter shit.

Then, today, we continued talking about what happened last night, trying to figure out happened, we played animal crossing, and it was nice. I felt comfy.

She asked me, a couple hours later, if I thought a break might help. I got scared, I felt terrified, scared, I didn't want to lose her, I wanted to cling to her and never let go.

I'm so scared and confused and I don't know what to do. My therapist has ignored me for 3 weeks after my first meeting with her and I haven't had anyone to bounce these thoughts off of except my poor girlfriend who is doing SO MUCH to help me through this.

Please let me know what you think.

TL;DR, I cannot tell if I love my girlfriend anymore and I'm terrified.",Depression

I'm 5'9 which is very short to most people it seems.

I'm 75% black 25% Korean so nobody looks like me.
I'm unemployed.

No car or license.

Not in school.

I sleep on a couch.

My penis is 6 inches give or take which is apparently really small.

I'm starting to get skinny fat.

I'm 22 and losing my youth.

Depression stole my teen years.

I'm apparently attractive but I'm too fucked up for anyone to love.

The only girl who would love me left after I fucked it up.

I'm still stuck on said girl since December 2018.

I've got Tinnitus that's probably connected to my TMJ/Dz but I'm too scared to call a dentist/specialist and being told I'm not enough of an emergency to see. (Fuck Covid)

That Tinnitus makes things lose meaning because all I'm able to think about is the ringing.

My only passion is music but the ringing makes me depressed as hell when I'm in my studio.

And lastly. I've got no future.

If I were to die today literally only my immediate family and 1 or 2 other people would even care.  

I'm poor.  Quiet.  Alone.  People don't really care whether I exist or not.  

What's the point of that?  If you don't affect those around you in any sort of way, then you're just a blip in the timeline of human existence.  Forgotten immediately. 

Maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's just being a guy in western society.  Maybe it's just being a minority.  I don't know.  

One example that sticks out in my mind really strongly is when my ex dumped me.  She was a terrible mentally fucked up person, liked to use drugs, drank a shit load and was black out drunk several times a week.  And yet, once she dumped me she immediately had another guy who wanted to date her.  As terrible of a person as she was, she still had someone who wanted to be with her.  Was it because she was a woman?  Because she was decently cute and would put out?  I don't know.  But to have her fuck me up as badly as she did, and move onto someone new like she wasn't the terrible one in the relationship really cuts deep.  

It's been like 2 years now and she's probably had 2 or 3 boyfriends in that time, and I still haven't dated since.  As a guy in America, if you don't reach out to people, no one gives a fuck about you and will never reach out to you.",Depression

I’ve tried to talk about these problems with my mom but she often just tells me they don’t matter and I’ll “walk them off”. 

This has lead me into the point of not knowing weather my problems are important or not, I’m middle class so I definitely know some people have it worse than me. That is why feeling bad about my problems feels stupid to me, and I know I should be happy for what I’ve got, yet I have not been happy for a long time.

I’ve been depressed for about 6 years (F20). Many diagnosises, treatments, still depressed. After some horrible circumstances during New Years where I had to flee the country for my safety, I realized my depression was strongly linked to my immediate family and how they treat me. Very rich, but neglectful stereotype. Mother had anger issues and used to insult me to the point of suicide from as long as I can remember until now.

We’re in lockdown. After going to uni I discovered this thing called self worth, but I had to leave my accommodation and go back home. It took only a few days before I was skipping meals (anorexia survivor) and on the verge of suicide ideation.  Once the lockdown started here I had a breakdown at the thought of being locked in a house with my whole family, not just for my mental health but relapsing on anorexia and likely attempting suicide, just down to being in the situation where I had been convinced by my family for years I deserved to die, and not being allowed to see friends or escape. My boyfriend convinced me to stay at his parents house, so I ran away before midnight.

Now. It’s been 3 weeks. I’ve been buying my own food but I don’t have infinite money. I feel ashamed and guilty. Thinking about the future makes me cry uncontrollably. I’ve started having nightmares about my family. I don’t know when I can go back to uni and my summer internships have been cancelled. It’s getting to me that I don’t have a home in the whole world, I’m couch surfing. I have other couches in other homes but  there’s no where that’s my home. And I feel like I don’t have family either. No money, no home, no family. Running out of goodwill. I’m very depressed. I’m unable to continue treatment for depression and I went off SSRIs about a month ago due to not being able to see a doctor. 

I have another 1.5 years of university that my parents pay for (no grants or loans at all where I live). I can’t get a job due to lockdown and no transport. I just don’t see any future at all. I can’t just forgive my parents. They lie, gaslight, and have screwed up family therapy in the past. I’m in danger around them because I will just obey them when they tell me I’m worthless and shouldn’t be alive. I’m not eligible for any services to help me. I don’t have a job, a house, work, or school for 5 months and it seems logical to end my life and tie up the loose end that no one wants. I don’t have another option.",Depression

Confession; I am fucking loving being in lockdown. I think it’s a really shitty situation and I’m sorry that everyone the world over is being affected to negatively by this, but I’m making the best out of it. I’ve only recently started working on my mental health and acknowledging my depression and anxiety since last December. This time to just focus on myself and be, with no responsibilities or family drama or struggling to get out of bed for people I don’t want to work for while making no money and actually getting to spend time with my husband has been a major blessing for me. A week before lockdown I was discharged from the hospital for having a major depressive episode due to a new medication. I usually compare my depressive mood to being dark grey/going black, which is where I was before lockdown, and now I’m a light/medium grey. I already know I’m gonna go back to black when it’s over. It’s going to be really hard to have to force myself to function all over again and knowing the same bullshit stressors that made me feel bad before are waiting for me is already bringing on the dark mood. It’s not like I’m getting salaried pay or anything, my unemployment is not going through and I’m fighting with them for over three weeks now, so I’m broke as shit.

Finally I just broke down, all my stress I’ve been keeping in, my thoughts, my sadness. I just cried, and I cried, at first I blamed it on my biology homework but I know that it was deeper than that. I kinda laid in my bed for the last few hours just, waiting, for nothing.

My window has a ledge off it where I can go put on, if I fell I wouldn’t die but would definitely get hurt. But I can also climb higher up. Anyway, I’ve always been scared to do anything “bad” because what if I get caught? What if the moment I decide to do something someone catches me or shows up? The neighbors? Anyone. But tonight I opened my window, I crawled out and I sat against my window. I played my music. I felt like at any moment I could slip from this ledge and... if I fell, I’d be caught. Not even concerned for myself. And I sat there, and I laughed. I laughed for a good five minutes. My legs were trembling and I laughed.

I don’t know if I have deeper root problems or something but, that’s the first time I ever did anything “bad” like sneaking out or what not. I felt crazy for laughing, but it felt so good.

* he stopped socializing, remains silent, lost in thoughts, blames others, doesn't take responsibility, panics a lot, no joy, no happiness in life, never travels, never goes out except for work, doesn't speak much and also gets angry at us if we enjoy ourselves. he makes us feel guilty for enjoying the life and being happy, threatens suicide. it is clear that failure and embarrassment have ruined his self esteem and self worth.
* not achieving his desired job had ruined his life. while growing up, i was told that this is my father's ""personality"" by my mother (who is a little narcissistic, blames my father for not getting a good job, always concerned about herself, doesn't listen to him talking, victim mentality, superiority complex, puts others down, overly criticizing and controlling nature, thinks she is too good for others, in the 23 years of their marriage my parents have NEVER NEVER EVER talked because my mother thinks that emotions are drama and only ""useless people talk about emotional stuff"" and she is too smart and optimistic to get serious).
* okay. both my parents are victims of life. while my father is sure rude, but failure kills you and i don't know if i should blame him. mother, on the other hand, is caring but doesn't sympathize with my father. she thinks of herself as a human while all others as animals. as if she is a victim in every case and others are her enemies. she expects others to behave well, but she can be childish, crying, shouting, and then threatens us that we will face our fate when we have our own kids.
* i see that the rest of my family who are successful in life have qualities very different from us: they are self assured, sympathetic, cheerful, good at socializing, take responsibility, think that everything is possible, have large social circle (we don't), encourage and believe in their children, doesn't put themselves down in front of others, don't threaten suicide, travel a lot, live lie to the fullest wherever they are. they also talk to their children (my parents don't) and encourage them to achieve great heights, when in problems they don't cry and moan, but look for solutions, stay chill and take control. on the other hand, my father goes into panic mode and blames others and seeks help from others for his problems. he stays distant in social gatherings and stays aloof in a corner.
* sadly my father has never got help for depression. no one even cares about him and that he has depression. i don't know if even he knows whether he has it. he is done with life. since my mother doesn't love him and he doesn't love my mother, their lives are miserable.",Depression

I could handle it then, things seemed a little brighter. Maybe not swell since I was already suicidal, but it wasn't this god damn bad. The depression started around the same time. 15, normal time to have depression or anxiety problems as a kid, right? 16 hit and I tried to work on myself, call me a quitter or a failure all you want. I started to hit the gym with my brother to the best I could do. I studied harder. Showered more often, ate less, ate better, tried to explore whatever semblance of a passion for anything I had. I don't want to turn this into a pity party, cuz this is all my fault in the end, I know that, I accept that, but God, fucking, damn. I never gained muscle, never toned, never lost weight doing the cardio. I failed more classes as I tried harder in them, I still managed to smell like shit after I kept clean constantly, I am still a fat fuck to this day. But now I am a skinny/fat fuck. I just watched the scale drop to 199, from 250 back when I was 16. I don't know why but this triggered me to write this. That stress has just built up to such a horrific summit now, at 19. The real world is hitting hard. Two dead end jobs that I've nearly lost due to Covid. Friends leaving me cuz I'm too busy. Rent pilling up for the parents who don't care. Got another rejection letter from another school for being too retarded to be apart of them. God it's like there's a fire in my skull all day long, all night long. I have dreams of being stressed. Of being light on fire. Or just dying. Doing anything to make this burning in my skull stop. I do the meditations, the fucking Japanese hand holding thing. I pray and I exercise still, but god, nothing nothing nothing calms me down. Nothing keeps the fire out of my head. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to lose it. I can't sleep anymore.

But I guess I should start with the fact that I'm not normally a suicidal person but the though has been crossing my mind whenever bad moments come and go since August (me moving in with my dad) and im also not just some edgy guy looking for attention, but I honestly don't know where else to go. I can't even tell if this is my way of coping, or if I think some magical solution will come from this. But im desperate. So one problem i've been having is with myself. It's not that i've everhaf trouble making friends but it's something else. I can't pinpoint it but I would make friends at school because imbalone. I have never actually walked up to someone to befriend them ive always just sat by myself and people came to me. Yet I was still a really outgoing person I just didn't how. Kind of pathetic for someone who has been to 7 different school because of moving huh? So I'm already a guy with not a lot of friends. But the main place I made friends was over online gaming. And ive met so many people that I know have changd me for the better. And i had thisnone really close friend named joey, I met him while playing rainbow 6 and we became good friends since. Bit then shorlynafter I moved here I was told by one of our other friends (who was close to his half brother) that he'd commitednsuicde. And that was the first big death ive ever had in my life. AND IT WAS ONLINE and in still thinking back to wether or bot I couldve done somthing to make it better because we were just having a blast on overwatch two nights begore. I know its bot my fault and that his family was mourning so much more. So i told everyone in our friend group to send his mother our condolences and it turned out okay.

Now indont know the character limit on reddit so im gonna keep thisbshprt. Im mainly just sad because I habe no form of control in my life right now. I move to minnesota with my dad with 4 other little brothers on is 11 and doesnt do any of his chpres and gets away with it he doesnt even feed his animals (beong two cats turtle and a lizard). Ones 9.amd has some learning problems, so he hets leniency, but that's fair. And the others who are 6 and 3 just run around messing up, stealing food from the kitchen, allowed to curse for some reason. And all of this haappens while they are under the watxh of my dad and step mom. So I the oldest at 16 have to clean the whole kitchen, that my step mom perpously messes up and allows my brothers to get away with eatimg in there. And the one that put me into this mess, cleaning the EMTIRE downstairs. So my dad and stepmom jave been sleeping down here for the past few nights with my little brothers (6&3) and they are supposed to go upstairs and sit in their bed by 8. But for some reason, they have been allowed to ait dpwn here with them and MESS UP THE PLACE. The parents are sitting there breaking their own rules by bringong all of these quilts and covers downstairs, Nd bringing tons of food and drinks. They also just let my little brother get all of these chips and drinks spilled all over the place. And then they just dont clean ot up... This has been happening for the past 3 nights now, and I began to get sick of it. Zince I'm cleaning up after MY OWN PARENTS, and no ome else is doimg any of their chores at all! My little brother (11) isnt cleaning his room or the upstairs bathroom, and my otger brother (9) ismt doing his room or the dinong room, amd getting away with it. And i get my xbox taken away because MY LITTLE BROTHERS WHO DONT EVEN LISTEN TO THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THEIR CHORES??? And since im supposed to be the ""big brother"" and clean up after everyones messes, and constantly tell these little rats to do what they are supposed to, and apparemtly act as the damn house maid 24/7. Just to get yelled at for doing a parents job... So later today, I tried to confront my dad softly, since the day befoew he asked me if everyrging was okay, and if I needed to talk about anything. And thatbtime i said no. But today i try and ask him ""dad, if you and my stepmom are here watching these kids, can you make sure they don't mess up""? And at first he said ""yeah"". Keep in mind that this same day, my stepmom said no games for anyone because she finally decided to do something aboutbthe kids not doing their chores, but it didnt make sense for me to be in trouble since i don't jave a SINGLE grade under 97, and my kitchen amd downstairs have been spotless (but my dad told me it was because I wasnt makomg the kids do their chores as i said above). And i guess she ran her mouth at my dad, because thats all he was saying when he started getting mad. So he literally just got mad because i politely asked him to not let the kids mess up.

So then, he decided to beat me...
I was just so shokes, and to thin kbaout it is starting to make me cry again because i cant believe that the one man i used ti look up to, just beay me over a situation so rediculous. And this was only the second time it happened. I remember about a month ago he was on the couch woth my step mom, and when i walked by he asked me about wheyger or not i had any friends. And of course i had some ao said yes, but I think some thoughts began to spill out of me because I didnt cry, but tears started to fall. And so my dad asked me why I was crying, and once I said no reason, he punched me to ground, and started throwing punhes at my ribs that later went into him slamming me onto the ground.. All because I was sad about my sacial life.
And of course theres a lot more to it, but im just so sad right now because there's nothing i can do, i cant talk about it because i would risk of making my dad or stepmom mad, i cant vent with any of my friends because im not allowed to, and i dont want to do nothing because I'd just go back to being a complete house maid. amd its not cleaning that's the problem, it's the punishments i get for not making the kids do their chores, or for not cleaning up after them roght. So I'm just lost as to what to do. Um just here contemplating running away, or flat out suicide. But I don't know what to do if I run away, simce I dont want to steal food and mess someone else's life up. So theres just suicide and the only thing stopping that is the fear of what could come since it either eternal nothingness, or if religion tirns out to be true, eternal damnation. But im afraid that once I'm pushed over that fear, there wouldnt be any going back...

-Three year old me wants to be a prodigy

-Elementary school me didn’t do that, but bragged about it enough to not have friends until fifth grade

-I made friends for first time but I was the loser of a basketball clique

-I am fat

-I go to middle school, basketball clique is no more. I fail to force myself in to a anime/meme clique.

-I get depressed and act 2010 meme cringey but this girl is nice to me and ends up being the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. Good grades

-Next year of middle school, my grades are good, I get in to a clique about Anime/Memes (different one), no depression and playing football. However, the nice girl is now in highschool.

-Winter break at cadet thing, all of my friends stopped laughing at my jokes and awkward silence. Two of them get real passive aggressive and we don’t talking very much but we all pretend that I’m still am friends with everyone

-Here we are, me not wanting to say I am depressed because I always thought depressed people need to get over themselves. On the internet too much, feuding with my parents, no friends, terrible physique and terrible grades. I miss the girl that was nice to me, I should have appreciated her more. I am really sad and quarantine is preventing me from making any new friends. I have turned to both YouTube for therapy videos and discord for friends, those have failed me. 

- I have a tall, wide frame. I know I’m smart. I have all of this potential and I just can’t motivate myself into anything anymore. I find myself wasting entire days doing nothing. I am not suicidal, but I’ve thought about it in the past.

- I find myself unable to get anything done anymore, ever. My grades suck and I haven’t been able to do more than one assignment every forty eight for the past few months.",Depression

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, and for my dissertation I am investigating how instagram use affects mood.  Current research is conflicted as to the effects of social media, and oftentimes research is done cross-sectionally and not in the immediate sense.  I am hoping to change this with my research, and better understand the immediate link between using Instagram and mood across a range of participants.

I am currently recruiting research participants who are between the ages of 18-35, use Instagram at least once every other day, and can complete phone surveys on their smartphones multiple times a day.

If you are interested in participating, it would be a huge help to our team.  The study will take one week, will involve filling out surveys on your own smartphone, and you will be compensated up to **$70.00** in Amazon gift cards for participating in all portions of the study. There will be no direct benefit to participants.

If you are interested in participating, please click the link to this survey and complete it:

me and my long time best friend who i would die for were playing minecraft. We got off and agreed to get back on at six, which would be two hours before we were gonna invite two others to our world. 

i haven’t slept in a day or so and i was gonna take a nap, but she said no bc we were gonna get on at six. six cake around and she didnt get on. i was pissed.

she then said at 8 that she never agreed to six and that she didn’t wanna answer my messages. she could have at least gave me a heads up so i could have slept or not felt like shit bc she was ignoring me

so at 8 i mention how she forgot ab me and she PISSED OFF and says how i’m lying and how she never said 6 when we fucking agreed to it’s making me all worked up and i wanna cry and fucking slice me open bc she always does this.

she always says that she’s right. She doesn’t know it’s so triggering to have to tell her that she’s right all the time even tho she’s not. i was right in this situation and she still made me say it was her so she wouldn’t get mad

she does it as a joke sometimes which is semi okay, but when she’s serious is makes me wanna fucking cry. When she’s in a bitch mood she’s in a bitch mood and i can’t even talk to her at that point bc i can’t deal with it.

and yeah, it’s triggering to be told your wrong all the time.

A survivor,1,g0yrwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0yrwu/a_survivor/,0,1586867011.0,"Dealing with depression is always a battle. For a 42yo guy like me, I have suffered since I was a pre-teen. There have been events in my life where I almost said ""That's it. I've had it"". 

But I'm posting to let you know that there is a light at the end of that deep dark tunnel or in some cases sunshine behind that grey cloud. 

How I have survived bipolar depression.
1. I say this to myself every morning in the mirror: ""I love myself. I love my job. I love my family. I love my life.""

2. I surround myself with light. What I mean by that is I laugh. Laughter not only forces that sour down expression to change. It releases a chemical to the brain that seems to counter act the gloomy feeling.

3. I have hobbies. From video gaming to crocheting. I keep busy. 

4. I have a Rose and Thorn coversation. Rose=the good things. Thorn= the bad things. 

5. I change those thorns to roses.

6. I remember a wise drag queen once said, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you going to love someone else."" She also said, ""You are your own worst saboteur. Don't let yourself get in your own way."" 

7. I talk to my mother, who also suffers from depression. We battle this together. 

8. I find joy ever in the smallest things. Like reading my favorite book or watching my favorite movie. Book=The Chronicals of Narnia. Movie= The Last Unicorn. 

9. I listen to inspirational music. 

10. Yes, this helps, I don't know why, but I cry. 

The reason why I am posting this is because what is going on this day in age, where isolation and social distancing has become the norm. More often then naught depression is the feeling of emptiness hopelessness, and loneliness. But you know what, it doesnt have to be. We can battle together.

I am still young, just a measly 22 years old. However, I feel like i have experienced much more than others when it comes to this...

It always begins the same.. infatuation, butterflies in the stomach, staring at your phone waiting for that message or call.

That is my favorite stage, without a doubt.

I get so involved in this stage, at times I wish I could just hit a pause button to have more time to appreciate the beginning of a relationship. In retrospect, I feel like I always move too fast, and that's where the problem arises.

Then you get to the relationship, and things are amazing. You begin to be together more, start declaring your feelings for the person as much as you can, the feelings of wanting to be with this person every minute of the day just keeps getting stronger.

Until something happens, usually something negative that happens to me, like a depressive effect or an instance of anxiety. And that is when the beginning of the end happens. When you show them that you're a human like everyone else, with real life problems.

And one day their tone is different, they don't sound the same as they used to, and slowly it progresses. Until you receive a text saying that its just not going to work out.

""Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""- Scott Fitzgerald

Idk why I'm posting this, just kind of felt like getting some things off my chest anonymously. 

I believe that tragedy, as awful as it is, can lead to a more beautiful life. The great thing about hitting rock bottom, is that once you're there and you can't go any lower, from that point on you can only do two things: stay at the bottom, or rise. 
Everyone faces hardship in their life, some more difficult and trying than others, whether that be the death of a loved one, drug abuse, family or marriage issues, we all face it at some point or another. 
This world is dark and cruel, and it shows no mercy. If you let it, this world will consume you. But if you let your hardships transform you instead of destroy you, you can create the best version of yourself that you have ever been. Tough times make stronger people, and the more resilient you become to this world, the better. 
In my personal experience, these last few years in my life haven't been very fun to say the least. I had knee and shoulder surgery which at the time disqualified me from the military (which was what I had always wanted to do since I was a kid), My dad almost died from medical malpractice, I lost my mother and aunt to suicide 6 months apart, found out my girlfriend of almost 3 years at the time was cheating on me, went through a horrible breakup, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, got kicked out of my house several times and slept in my car in an Arby's parking lot, gained a shit ton of weight, and lost some of my best friends. I completely let myself go as a person.

One day I had just had enough of the mental torment I was in, so I put a gun in my mouth. I sat there in my car for hours trying to get myself to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it. That's when I realized that if I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger then, I could never convince myself to do it in the future. That was my rock bottom. 

I didn't kill myself, but I killed the old version of myself. I decided from that day on to the future, I would work on becoming the person I had always wanted to be, and let my trauma mold me into a better person. 

3 years later, I've come to terms with the death of my mother and no longer blame myself, I don't use drugs anymore, gained control of my drinking habits, went from being 245lbs to 190lbs and in-shape, and I even joined the Army like I had always wanted to. I gained control of my depression and now live a much better life. Honest to God, I haven't had the thought of suicide cross my mind since that day in the Arby's parking lot. 

The way I try to look at life is like this: always appreciate the good times and cherish them, because you could always have it worse. Don't be in a state of constant self pity, because it wouldn't take long to see someone else that has things much worse. I'm sure some of you have had a rougher time in life than I ever had, or could even imagine. 

Dark humor is something that I truly embrace now. Some will say that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I disagree. You can't take life too seriously, you just have to roll with the punches. 

Today I'm thankful that I'm alive, breathing, and able to see the world with two eyes and a healthy body and mind. 

Be your own hero, and aspire to be the type of person you wanted to be as a kid. Use your past trauma to mold you into what you want to be.

Create something beautiful out of your tragedy.

I had a breakup a few weeks before the quarantine started, and I've picked this old mental scab until it bled. I've acutely self aware, I really wish I wasn't.

She broke up with me because she was cheating on me (for the 3rd time) but she ended it in January. Yes, I know why didn't I end it a long time ago? I'm a push over and let her walk all over me. Even now I still love her even though I know she has some mental problems. It's been 3 months. 

She lied that I broke into her house (while she accused me of many other things, that was the one that got her enough to get a pfa against me, and I never got to tell my side of the story in court. Also, the name of the house is still in both of ours, and I allowed her to have the house for her and my daughter) but either a stranger did it, or the more likely scenario is her or her new scumbag boyfriend(who I don't trust around my daughter at all) did it to try to get me out of their 
 life so I couldn't pick up my daughter by myself and not allow me to grab my things from the house.  

Also, shout out to that boyfriend who tried to make fun of me for living with my parents. Hey, you dumb fucker, i just gave you a house to live in, that's still in my name, and that slut you are living with is the reason I had to move back in with my parents 

Anywho, when the pandemic started she and him decided to plan a flight somewhere, knowing full well what is happening in the world. She did finally cancel it after she got laid off and had the stay at home order in place. But she was already willing to risk her health and possibly come back sick to our daughter, just to be with her new shitty boyfriend. Because she doesn't care about our daughter.

Then last Thursday, she said she can't keep our daughter for Friday(which was the plan). Because she has ""plans"". Things are fucking closed, you shouldn't have plans for anything. So I kept my daughter for over 4 days because of her negligence. We had a deal to split our daughters time 3.5 days a week. Which I'm fine with.

NOW, today I find out she suddenly wants to keep our daughter until Saturday. 6 fucking days. When I was supposed to get her this Thursday. Of course I can't do anything. I can't talk to her and ask her why. She can only talk to my mom. So something is fucky and I don't even get an explanation. My mom won't ask her because she's tired of being in the middle. But I deserve to see my daughter. I actually love her and give her all my attention. Suddenly this neglectful person wants to spend time with our daughter? Doubtful. She's been fucking with me for years. And she managed to make a pfa happen so I can't even check in to make sure things are ok, to make sure my daughter is safe. She's breaking all this social distancing stuff because she has no care in the world. Because she doesn't care about anything. 

I've had depression for years, but since January, this shit is out of control. She's pressing buttons that's shouldn't be pressed. And everyone believes her because she is the mom, the girl, and I have no say over anything. And I don't know how much more I can take. My brain feels broken. And I want her to feel like I do. She deserves being mentally broken.

I can’t let them in because I know what I’m gonna do. I’ll just manipulate them, I’ll lie to them, I’ll create a completely false version of myself and present it to them, even adopting a whole new persona that fits in completely with their wants and desires just to have control over them.

But because I don’t want any of that to happen, I self isolate. I’m posting this right now because I have a coworker who’s been trying to get closer to me lately and try to get me to talk more and I try to let her know I’m not interested and more often than not, I end up walking out in the middle of her sentences.

I can literally feel the disappointment from half of the people I’m regularly around because most of them were eager to get to know me but I shrugged all of them off. 

It’s also, ironically, the loneliness that bugs me about this.

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",2361,eczhm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eczhm3/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_couple_days_ago_my/,392,1576818660.0,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition.

I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream?

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression

Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me.

I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression.

I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.",Depression

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone.

I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,1846,fmfemk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fmfemk/im_a_13_year_old_boy_who_is_abused_and_need_help/,187,1584828105.0,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?",Depression
I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,1848,e9uflv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9uflv/im_tired_of_being_everyones_therapist_when_no_one/,133,1576217102.0,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",Depression

I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent.

You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.

We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?).

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police?

Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression).

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again.

Open letter to my son,1466,bmjokm,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bmjokm/open_letter_to_my_son/,130,1557436538.0,"To my beautiful boy. My sweet, sweet little man. 

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong. 

A mothers love is like no other. It’s true. Without you I probably wouldn’t even be here. You’ve taught me that no matter what I have been put in this world for a reason. To be your best friend. You deserve the entire world.

Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

My girlfriend died,1356,a46ol5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a46ol5/my_girlfriend_died/,64,1544264084.0,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

I lost my job, no way to pay my tuition (it’s a monthly bill through a trade school not an official university) I won’t be able to graduate until I pay my tuition off in full and I’m still about $400 away with absolutely no income coming in. I smoke weed to help with the depression and anxiety and I’m almost out of it. I have $1 in my bank account. I’m scared, I don’t want to go back to a shitty job just to pay the rest of my tuition. I’ve been cooped up at home unable to see my friends, having to tiptoe around my stepdad who had something to say about everything I do including scolding me every time I leave the house during this crisis. I don’t know if I want to keep living. Sometimes I wish I’d catch the Coronavirus and go out without having to pull the trigger myself because I’m a coward.

He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply.",Depression

I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys.

>I think OP is saying is that they thought and expected the graduation of medical school to be something that finally made them happy and/or gave them internal validation that their presence on earth had meaning or reason. When they graduated and still didn’t feel that purpose or happiness it could feel like that was supposed to be it and they worked hard for it and it still didn’t help.

"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again!

No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol.

Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,1061,cbhfwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cbhfwy/therapy_just_made_me_more_aware_of_how_isolated_i/,55,1562797978.0,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.

I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem.

I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",Depression

I sold my guns.,1008,a6qv8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a6qv8n/i_sold_my_guns/,69,1545009953.0,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",Depression

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""",Depression

Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.,978,eophbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eophbs/i_cant_stand_it_anymore_im_committing_suicide/,243,1579056529.0,"Why does this happen to me.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading.

I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope.

It was a personal choice, but I felt that everyone I worked with wanted me to leave. I have severe issues with self-doubt. I feel like a fraud, like my MSEd is not legit, I didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.

My family is financially supportive when I need them but not much else. My mom just tells me to take my meds (I do), or she offers me her meds. I told my sister earlier this year that I was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband I’m going to go insane!”

My own husband is patient but not very supportive. I’ve been on the couch since Monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how I am. I know he wants me to return to “normal”. I worry he’ll give up on me.

I interviewed for another job last week and this week. It was an adoption counselor position, something I’ve always dreamt of. I did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. I didn’t get the job. 

While still working, I found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support I needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. I made the mistake of telling her that I smoke weed sometimes. She then began questioning my work and my physical health. She also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg Prozac), as I was somehow “putting my health at risk”. Needless to say, I plummeting deeper into depression.

I spoke to my PCP and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. After two days, I was so sick I had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. When I asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”

I guess I feel hopeless and alone. I have two little boys who are 3 and 6. My oldest son has severe special needs. I am able to take care of them, but I cannot get off the couch to do anything else.

You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. ",Depression

I don’t even know if I’m using it right haha. But I wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a “damn me too” because it really helps knowing I’m not alone in my feelings.
I am currently seeing a therapist. He is great I’ve been going to him for a while, but unfortunately it’s a little hard for me to see him because he’s at my university’s counseling center and he’s pretty much always booked.
I so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave. It’s definitely something I’m going to look into, and it wasn’t anything I was aware of until now, so thank you for mentioning it!
Someone suggested I wasn’t going to class just because. I feel like for clarification’s sake I should mention the reason I haven’t been is because I got very sick (I know these absences are excused) and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult. I live about 20 minutes away from campus, so it’s not like I can just run out of my dorm into my class haha.



I don’t know really know where else to go or how to format this so I guess I’ll just bullet point Why My Life Is Extra Shitty Right Now:

• College is kicking my ass right now. I haven’t been to class in like 3 weeks 1) what’s the point in going anymore I am so far behind by now and 2) I don’t even want to be in college right now and it’s taken me a year and a half to really realize I only went because I felt pressured to by peers and family. I want to drop out so badly, because I know I’m just not in the headspace to do it right now, but my family expects a lot out of me because I was “smart” in high school and I don’t want them all to hate me and also I will lose a pretty big scholarship if I quit going and shakdnhdiebd (not to mention NO ONE ELSE MY AGE is having any problems with this, just me which makes me feel 50x worse about the whole thing. like I have friends taking 18 hours this semester and I’m so behind and I’m only doing 13 haha what a LOSER amrite)

• I found out last week that I’m losing my job. I work retail and yeah I could find another job easy, but I was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store I work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan. Not to mention it’s almost holiday season, I don’t want to be the newbie at a new job when it’s already gonna be hectic and I love the place I work at right now and I’m just sad in general it’s gonna be gone

• I started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes I feel fine but mostly I’m just exhausted and can’t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon, which REALLY doesn’t help my whole not going to class thing
I’m just so stressed and have a constant headache I go to see my therapist later today which is good I guess but I just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my head

if anyone read this then thank you, I’ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha",Depression

...and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do?

I just made an appointment to discuss therapy and/or medication changes. I've been on this road before (pre-baby depression) with a lack of results, but for the sake of my wife and child, I'm willing to try again. Wish me luck everybody.

---End Update---

Alright, parents and child-lovers everywhere - get ready to hate me. I don't blame you, and really I don't care. I can't be unapologetically honest with anyone I know personally, so you strangers on the internet are the only outlet I can use.

I have dealt with depression since middle school, so this bullshit isn't new to me. About 2 months ago, I and my wife had our first baby, and those two months have been the worst time of my life. I have been in dark places before, but becoming a dad has taken me to hellacious places in my mind that I never knew existed within me. For starters, I feel no love or connection to my baby at all. All I see is an obnoxious living ball of needs. I never wanted kids growing up, in fact, I have always hated babies and children under 13-15 years old. I only agreed with my wife to try for a baby because 1) My wife wanted a baby for most of her life, and I wanted to make her happy. 2) I thought the parental instinct and unconditional love would come naturally when she was born and I started interacting with her.

You always hear parents say that they love their kids more than anything, and they are worth all of the trouble they cause, but I strongly disagree. I want our baby out of my life until they are at least a teenager, maybe even forever.

I am a very analytical person, and I have gone over all of the feasible options available to me, and they are all so fucking horrible to me that I honestly prefer suicide over facing the rest of my choices and their consequences.

I love my wife with all of my heart, so the idea of divorce tears me apart even if it would let me be rid of our baby. I know what kind of life the two of them would live if we did divorce, and there is no way I could be that cruel. So I am essentially stuck staying in my marriage and keeping the baby, and I just have to suck it up and live with the worst fucking mistake I ever made. The idea of raising a baby, toddler, child, teen, etc is literally Hell for me and experiencing it is proving to be worse than the idea alone. Hence why suicide has started sounding so good.

My depression has always seemed to revolve around the notion that ""Life takes too much effort/work"", which really fucking sucks since a baby is nothing but Goddamn effort/work. I am literally forced to care for and sustain the worst trigger I have ever encountered for my depression. The more I interact with my baby, the worse my mental health gets. The less I interact with my baby, the shittier I feel about what kind of father I'm being, which also leads to a decline in my mental health. No matter what I do, I am in a perpetual downward spiral.

I don't want to hurt our baby, but I can't deny that the temptation arises when it won't stop crying. I find myself visualizing terrible things when I am desperately hoping it will shut the hell up.

I can't even put all of the words down for some of my feelings lately. I feel so horrible about the way I see my own child and even worse about the fact I can't do anything to make it better.

And before anyone asks, yes I have talked to my wife about this and to make a long story short, It didn't really help my mental dilemma. Nothing got worse by talking about it (besides learning she hopes to have a 2nd kid one day (hell no)), but she did not have any input that I had not already thought of myself.",Depression

She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  

I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 

Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

*EDIT* *UPDATE*

I saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. She is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time.

""you just need to sleep more,"" or ""try to relax,"" or my personal favorite, ""have you tried meditating or yoga?"" HA. we've all been there. 

i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️",Depression

It's done.

Nobody. Not a single person. I told my wife I love her and she will be fine. Both are true.

Edit/update : I don't really know what to say, I honestly didn't think my post would be seen by anyone at all. I feel like now I owe everyone an update.

I did take the pills. I ended up taking a cocktail of about 70 pills of varying drugs. I was planning on taking twice as many, but my wife walked in and saw me (I thought the room was securely locked) and freaked out and took all the rest. I was too out of it to even challenge her the benzos were kicking in hard, and she called the emergency line. Ambulance picked me up, dropped me off at the hospital, and I was told I wouldn't be seen for 5 hours (UK hospital). The idea of having to wait that long just to be seen just reinforced my feelings of being totally rejected and low priority in society. I left. I got more pills and took them. I told my wife, and she wouldn't stop calling me and calling the police. She wouldn't stop calling and it drained my phone. Literally the only thing I felt like doing was listening to my favourite songs as I passed. That's all I wanted. The closest place I could think to go was the hospital cafeteria, which was still relatively close, and I had a charger with me since I was expecting to spend some time in the ER anyway. The sockets in the cafe were all disabled, but thankfully the socket in the hospital chapel was not. I spent about half an hour there charging my phone, and my wife had phoned half the city by that time, including my university support. As soon as I turned on the phone, I got a call from a private number that turned out to be the hospital asking where I was since they were ready for me. I admitted I was in the chapel, and that's where they found me huddled up in a corner, a nurse and 3 security guards saying they were there to help me. That was 7 hours ago, I'm still here and the hospital staff have treated me terribly ever since. I know that this sounds like it's supposed to have some kind of happy ending to it, but quite frankly this entire experience has just been dehumanising and has made me realise that there should not be any more half-measures. I'm not happy I'm still here. I'm a hostage and they're forcing me to stay against my will ""for my own safety"". I've been through the ER routine more often than I can count, but this time has been more nightmarish than I could have possibly imagined. One way or another, I will never be going back to the ER again.

On a more positive note, I cannot begin to thank or repay the many kind words I've received. My inbox is practically full, and in some ways so is my heart.

one time i just saw my friends having fun together and i stopped in my tracks to go to them. i stared from afar how joyous they were without my presence, therefore i maintained it that way. i kept avoiding them, i just didn't have anymore energy to hold a basic conversation. i cant even finish tasks anymore. im still friends, we still talk, but they know how i feel now ans they don't understand me. they thought i was just having mood swings. how i wish that was the case.

The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering,836,2dcibu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2dcibu/the_robin_williams_posts_are_triggering/,249,1407889771.0,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.


The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about ""caring."" If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, ""Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff.""

Rick and Morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts I've ever seen on television,828,3iq35k,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3iq35k/rick_and_morty_had_one_of_the_most_realistic/,143,1440797501.0,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a ""cry for help"" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out.

It keeps getting worse one day at a time. I've always had severe social anxiety and did what I could to avoid talking to people. I tried dating a few times in my life but the relationship wouldn't last more than a few weeks. I would be extremely nervous and wouldn't know what to say but I would tell myself that every other guy on the planet can do this so I can too. It finally dawned on me that I have no social skills and can't hold conversation to save my life. You might think I'm over exaggerating but you'd be wrong. I really can't think of anything to say. Even if you were to give me a list of things to say I'm not intelligent or quick witted enough to hold a 5 min conversation let alone hours upon hours of talking to someone I'm interested in. It's like my mind is a blank slate the never got programed. I tried therapy and meds but I finally realized it's hopeless. There is something severely wrong with my brain.

"I'm 24. My father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. In the span of 4 months.",790,22zf8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/22zf8v/im_24_my_father_died_my_girlfriend_left_my_mother/,84,1397483033.0,"I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 

And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 

EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 

For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today. ",Depression

First off, as I'm sure is the case for most of you, this post was extremely hard to write. I don't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody. I am in a pretty good situation overall, with a good family, great girlfriend, great friends, and a nice apartment. Yet, despite all that, I feel so incredibly shitty most of the time. It makes me feel guilty - why should I feel like crap when I have it so much better than probably 99% of the world? Yeah, everyone gets stressed by work, traffic, money, etc but it's called life. 

These are thoughts I have all the time which is why I don't like to talk about my feelings much. I see a therapist and I don't really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me. But I absolutely hate talking about it otherwise. The thought of making my problems other people's problems is horrible to me. 

Another thought that I have is do I just use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? Like am I just not mature enough to deal with real life so I can just say to myself ""hey I'm depressed so it's okay that I don't give maximum effort?"" I am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating.  I often just think I'm incredibly lazy and that I use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed. Has anyone had these thoughts before (and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit - I'm brand new here). I just don't feel like I'm cut out to deal with the real word. I don't have whatever ""it"" is to be successful professionally - between social anxiety, inability to concentrate, and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive.

my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it’s inhabitants - that it’s all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn’t help this feeling. it’s not a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. just a constant state of being “out of it”.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

I just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that ACKNOWLEDGING MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A BAD THING!

UPDATE: I thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments. In the place of “African-American” I originally had “Person of Color” because I am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups.

Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now.

I've been depressed since I was 9. I suppose I was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. A lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. An inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. Most people my age (I'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but I only feel helpless. I am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like I can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world.

A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. 

When she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.

So fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.

TL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.

I went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so I wouldn't have to take anyone with me. That's when I drove by this massive LITTERING IS ILLEGAL sign and guess what? There's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! At this point I was beginning to somewhat calm down. I turned around and parked on the side of the road. I picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. Luckily I had a cheap duffel bag I wasn't using. Felt like I lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). After that I just got in my car and drove home. It's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.

My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

I hope you never have to really read this letter. I think it’s more for me than it is you. You’re only 3 right now and I know you can’t understand why Mommy cries..
Why mommy has a hard time just opening her eyes 
“Wake up mom” she says.
But Mom is in a dark place,
A hole where the sun can’t shine.
A nameless place
One where Mom doesn’t even want to see her own face.

You see today is a bad day 
And it hasn’t even started 
Mom is angry and Mom is sad 
And baby doesn’t know why,
“Am I really that bad?”

But you see sweetheart, it was never you. 
You see mommy has a condition that no one can physically see
But it hides inside her 

Like the deep, dark sea
Sometimes the waves ravage inside her 
And she just doesn’t want to go out in the world
She doesn’t even want a reminder 
Don’t tell me what time it is
Cuz some times she feels it would be easier to

Turn time off

But Gracie just wants to go play 
Mommy is too busy drying her eyes
“What’s wrong momma?”
But mommy doesn’t even really know.
The tears ebb and flow
While her heart just races

Mommy looks in her baby’s eyes 
And baby girl just knows she’s hurting
As Mom tries to disguise 
All that is going on, baby girl wonders...”what’s really wrong?”

Because Mom lives with depression and anxiety
There really is no disguising.
Most days she tried to put on a smile, reads a little positivity and tried to climb
The ladder
Out of the hole
Choose the latter 

I’m writing you this letter to show you mommy knows
I know how hard it must be to live with me
Because mommy lived with it too

I watched my mother 
Cry and sink and eventually even falll down the gutter 
To the dark places no one wishes to wander.

You see I never understood either. As a child I just wanted to be good for her, and never wanted to make her sad...just as I see in your eyes 

Please know mommy’s trying
And I would never contemplate dying
For that would mean life with out you
And darling
You are the sunshine to my dark moon",Depression

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 

Have a heart. ",Depression

I buy an energy drink every Wednesday because that was the night I used raid with my old WoW guild. Best times of my teenage years, and every Wednesday I had an energy drink alongside me. I'll probably do it tomorrow, too.

I stay up until 5AM regularly because I long to feel like I did when I was 14 and I remember staying up watching old movies I'd never seen before. I no longer get that sense of awe.

I used to eat pizza from the same place because I used to do it with my old band. The only place we ever went to and whenever I eat there I feel like I'm back in those days. 

Occasionally I walked the same route home that I did in High School so I can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl I fancied on MSN. That was a decade ago, though. MSN doesn't exist, she's moved on and I don't have anything to look forward to. 

The pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. I fucking cried because I felt like that part of my life was finally gone. 

I wondered if, in 10 years, I'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories I'm making now. I don't know if I will.

This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back.

"Frustrated by the phrase ""happiness is a choice""",695,ffy952,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ffy952/frustrated_by_the_phrase_happiness_is_a_choice/,97,1583803675.0,"I don't subscribe to the idea that anyone who has truly suffered a depressive episode actually believes that happiness is a choice. The implication of that phrase is that victims are *choosing to suffer*. It's victim blaming at its very core. We can't choose our thoughts any more than we can choose the weather. Happiness is a not a switch that can be flipped at will, but every time I hear ""happiness is a choice"", I only start to think that something must be wrong with me because I can't find the switch. But of course I can't find the switch, because **there is no switch**. Negative thoughts are intrusive and undesired--they appear without our consent, and we have to actively fight them. That takes effort, and sometimes a *lot* of it.

The only thing I think we can choose is our actions; or rather, choose where we apply effort. That can take the form of just doing a little bit of work in our daily lives (making your bed, folding your clothes, cleaning your room, etc.), but in the end, we still only get to choose to apply effort *in spite* of unhappiness. We don't choose unhappiness.

I'm curious if anyone feels differently, though. What is your take on the phrase ""happiness is a choice""? Do you agree or disagree?",Depression

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see ""if you wanted to, you would"" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

I just showered. Tomorrow I start a new job. Feeling hopeful.,674,755uj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/755uj2/i_just_showered_tomorrow_i_start_a_new_job/,58,1507541021.0,"Reddit,

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

All of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod I think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. 

Here's a little something about my first day:

These new co-workers, I already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty Cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the IT guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but I can't help but chuckle at that. The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now. 

I assisted during one procedure today. And it went well. My preceptor has twenty years of experience in GI and I can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. I can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. And has the answers to my simple questions. I'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but I'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before I move to #2 then #3.

I also was given a few checklists to complete. One was computer education, which I completed entirely. Long story short, I had a great first day!!",Depression

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this:

Hi all,1,g21fj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g21fj7/hi_all/,0,1587015736.0,"
I am 20 years old male
I came across a health issue 6 months ago and how I dealt with it is.. eye opening.

I had some stomach issues stem up. There was a thought in my mind that I had bowel cancer because I had all the symptoms, blood in stool, constipation, you name it. The night before my blood tests and a stool test that looks for blood, I cried thinking about it. What was I thinking about? I was imagining that the doctor says they found what I was fearing. Then I started thinking what I would tell my family. Would I lie? Say that I love them all and they have been all I ever wanted and more? 

Or would I tell the truth? Would I tell them how I truly felt about them? Maybe so they could change? Would I tell them that I don’t mind if something in my bowels is gonna kill me?

I mean, I am not going to lie, when I had that fear from built up anxiety, I actually wanted to live. I really did. But here I am months later, back to my normal life. Why did these feelings go? Why can’t I get this feeling when I am healthy? Why am I suicidal now, but when I was close to “death” I wanted to live so badly?

Mind you, this is not the first night that I felt this way. I’ve had uncountable nights and days that I had this feeling. In fact, 6 years ago when I was 13 I dreamed that I blew my h*** off with a shotg** in the balcony. Then I turned into a ghost and went inside my house, telling my family how Sorry I am but nobody replies or sees me. I woke up crying. Since that dream I promised myself I would never do such a thing. My thoughts might say that theyre better off without me, but I know, from that dream, that if I go that way I won’t make anything better.

Growing up I was very sensitive to peoples feelings, the world around me, found everything funny and was all in all a very happy, caring and loved person.

Through high school I smoked weed maybe once or twice every 6 months or so, so not a lot... mostly because I was sensitive to it and had strong reactions. 

Anyway, at 17 some buddies and I camped out overnight. My life has never been the same after that night. I had a soul destroying terrifying experience that truly can’t be explained with words. I can only describe it as an episode in which I experienced the most extreme physical pain, fear, terror, paranoia, anxiety, crazy visuals, blacking out, my sight was MESSED up, losing control of my entire body, and so SO much more for several hours before ‘reality’ started to return I never really spoke about it because my words really don’t do it justice at all. It was literally hell and my brain went through something extreme, I know it.

Things were a bit weird after this but nothing too noticeable. Looking back, this is when my life went from being colourful to slowly fading away. I’m no brain expert but I feel like my brain was so deeply traumatised that it changed into some sort of safety mode, causing me to feel NOTHING and empty, all the time.

My symptoms;
- I feel empty all the time. I can’t remember the last time I felt any emotion, good or bad.
- anhedonia ( I cant remember the last time I really felt pleasure from anything )
- no sex drive what so ever (this wasn’t the case before the accident) 
- erectile dysfunction 
- basically I can’t feel anything, it’s like my brain doesn’t react to anything that happens anymore. I don’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed.
-I can’t cry, I sometimes lie in bed trying so hard to cry but nothing happens.
- I used to have a sense of self, I feel like a walking dead body now with nothing going on inside of me
- constantly fatigued and don’t care about anything 
- loss of imagination and my thoughts are so distant and empty

However for the last 3-4 months, I've been making quite a big effort to pull myself out of the depression with some success. However from time to time daily I do fall back into my old thought patterns. During this time I usually managed by keeping to myself(for 2-3hrs) and making an effort to keep myself busy through one of my hobbies (I'm 17 and live with my family so talk to them regardless of my mood). Usually my sprinting practice is the most successful at getting me out of the mental state. 

Very recently I began speaking to a counselor (online due to the quarantine circumstances). It hasn't caused much difference yet but I am still hopeful. The counselor recommended that I still reach out to 1 or 2 closer friends during times where I feel like this. This is different to my usual method however I was happy to try it.

**The main issue:**

When choosing someone to talk about it with, I chose a friend who I know had also been through a similar mental struggle and had opened up to me about it. When this happened, I was always happy to talk to him and help him through it. Therefore I assumed it'd be good to talk with him as he'd be able to relate. 

However, when I've tried talking about what I'm going through with him after a few messages he'll just leave my message unopened (for around a day), this is unusual because if we're having a usual conversation he'd reply sooner. After having done this he'll begin a conversation on a completely different topic. Basically ignoring what I said before. The first time this happened I just ignored it thinking that it was probably a coincidence. I spaced out each attempt by a few weeks. However after the 2nd and 3rd time it began to bother me. Especially when I see him posting on his story or group-chats etc.

Therefore, I am wondering if anyone has had something similar happen? and what did they do about it? Should I just communicate what I've noticed and be honest that it's bothering me (this feels quite odd for me to do as I'm usually quite a jokey person and we usually joke around together).",Depression
Is anyone else sad for all the time they spent before they found out about their depression and got help for it?,1,g1uwep,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1uwep/is_anyone_else_sad_for_all_the_time_they_spent/,0,1586995664.0,"In high school, everyone told me that when you turned 18 you had to go be independent and self sufficient. My first year of college went ok. But the second year, I became profoundly depressed. I stopped going to classes and my grades suffered. I thought at the time maybe that I was just gaming the system by skipping class because you can skip class in college with fewer consequences. But what was really going on was that I was depressed and I spent all this time on Facebook or just staring at my wall and listening to music, feeling sorry for myself. But I never wanted help because I never wanted to look weak. And I never realized there was a problem with an expectation that you avoid looking weak at all costs. That was an undeniable fact life had taught me (so I thought). I didn't realize I was still affected by my childhood trauma. I didn't talk to anyone. I spent years like that, trying to work and study and always being fucked over by depression/trauma, and failing to recognize it as such. I thought I was just worthless, unable to work hard because of some internal defect. I remember scouring the DMV thinking I had to have some personality disorder. I became obsessed with introversion and the MBTI because I then thought ""oh I can't do the shit I need to do because I'm an INTP trapped in an extrovert feeler world"". I kept deluding myself by following every failure with an ""it must be because I'm too smart for everything"" pep talk. My life is not a bed of roses now, but at least I acknowledged I needed help for depression and PTSD, and got it. 

Anyway, TL;DR is that I spent over a decade in denial of my trauma and depression.",Depression

First off, my family has a history with depression. I know my grandmother has it, my father has it, and my grandfather may have had it too. Ever since middle school just year after year I felt worse and worse. Now I'm 23 with one good real life friend (who is my best friend) and one good online friend. Been single for like 7-8 years and just hate it. A long time ago had some of my old friends confide in me about being suicidal (even my best friend) and I tried to help them out the little I could (fortunately they're still with us). Though that's left me with no one I felt like I could turn to.   
Once out of high school I felt like I was in a swamp. Its thick muddy waters that makes it hard to move in. While you got all sorts of dangerous creatures like alligators and snakes watching your every move. On top of the blood sucking mosquitoes and leeches that latch onto to you day after day. At first I'd try my best to move forward you know, try to get somewhere, to get out of the swamp but no matter how hard I tried, how fast I moved, I always wound up back in the same spot of the swamp. I'd see lights and hear voices and I'd go toward them and yell out with my arm reaching for anything, but nothing ever happened and again I was in the same spot. As days went on, my will to move forward, call out, reach out, all faded away. But I'm an insane fool, and every so often I try again, reaching, moving, yelling, only to end up back in my little spot. I get rid of the leeches and swat the mosquitoes and even chase away the snakes but I don't bother with the alligator. Cause I wake up every morning, wishing that I didn't. Every day it feels like I look at that alligator and ask ""Why haven't you eaten me yet?"" and I never get an answer.  
So I'm just standing still, in my little spot. Watching as things go by, and people pass me. Waiting for the day where either someone finally pulls me out or the day that gator finally gets me.",Depression

The causes of what I'm feeling aren't really talked about in the article, but I mention it for some context.

This pandemic is inflicting widespread suffering and I would give back every moment I've had of happiness so that it'd go away this instant. But like..I'm feeling pretty good? 

I think it's because in times of crisis, humanity tends to come together. I've communicated more with my friends in the past few weeks than I normally do. We've played MarioKart and Animal Crossing online, we've video-called, we're starting up a tabletop game...I haven't been allowed in sink into my depressive habit of isolating myself and then wondering why no one will reach out to me.

It's...really nice. It's given me the motivation to do more chores and get interested in my old hobbies again. I just wish this awful virus didn't have to be (at least part of) the reason why I'm experiencing this. :\\

The week i finally decided to apply for Medicaid (my health insurance doesn't cover therepy)  and get in the process of maybe getting help i got kicked off my campus because of coronavirus, and in person sessions are out of the question in any capacity. This was in mid march.

They talk about how terrible this quarantine is when they both work from home and have an easy time waking up every day. I wake up and have to fight myself to even leave my bed. I know they view this as laziness.

I feel anxiety even leaving my room now because i don't feel equipped to deal with whats outside my door. 
I get halfway through making meals sometimes and just stop because its not worth it. If i burn something it usually means I'm not eating because i don't have the will to remake it.

I feel like my life isnt just on hold but regressing, I feel like all the trauma I've gotten from others and damage I've given myself has no value. All i can think about is how much time I've obliterated feeling bad, and how I'm never getting it back, and how I'm never going to stop adding to it.

Don’t know how to be more disciplined / productive and don’t know where the boundary of ADHD / Depression ends and when me being undisciplined starts)

Hi. So two years ago I basically was on the top of my game. I was doing really well in school (then a junior in high school), got the job of a lifetime, and had awesome productivity / work life balance. This was also my first year in school being diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive, Anxiety, and Depression. (diagnosed end of sophomore year)

Everything fell apart. I lost the job, my dad went to hospital, I accumulated debt by borrowing money from friends while sustaining myself while my dad was in the hospital, grades died, etc.

My dad is now fine, and I’m recovering in most aspects in a stable way except my productivity and discipline. 

(BIG NOTE: My medication has never really been a good thing. I used to be on meds but I haven’t taken meds regularly in a long time. My meds make my heart rate go crazy and generally worsen every aspect of both my ADHD and Anxiety and essentially only works after the meds wear off and I’m on the come down.)

I have so many aspirations. I want to continue doing design. I want to pursue music too. I want to do well in school. I want to continue to watch a ton of YouTube and anime and such and be cultured and on top of what’s going on in the world right now. Yet this is an example of how my days have been going.

10 AM: I wake up. 
1 PM: I work out
10 PM: I finish some assignments that are dude before midnight
12 AM: PS4 / Anime
3 AM: Bed

I don’t know where the time goes. I don’t really enjoy my time, nor am I productive. My friends give me advice which I read and agree that it’s logical but yet i still find myself at the end of the day asking what did I just do.

I've had mixed feelings on this label. I'm the kind of person who won't test for something so that it doesn't exist. Like dyslexia, I was offered a test in Uni and didn't take it because the answer is no I don't have dyslexia until proven otherwise.

I have this same mentality with depression. I also wouldn't even know where to start. people say go see a gp but I've never had one and I'm not in a position to see one without my family asking questions. 

I'm also not into self-diagnosis and would never say I have depression. I may be depressed or feeling down from time to time but I just don't know.

I've always been self-aware and existential (if that's even a word). I've always thought why this life. Why am I in this body. Why do I have these feelings, these emotions and these motivations or lack of movitation. I feel like there should be a grand scheme to things but I can't dedicate myself to one with no evidence. I'd love to believe in reincarnation but what's the point if you cant remember a past life. Id love to believe in afterlife but like does that mean for 80+years you get on earth you get an eternity of just watching sounds tedious. I'd love to believe in heaven but then does that mean there is a hell.

Anyway down to the main point. I'm going to try and put this into words but I don't even know what to call it. I am not suicidal, I don't want to kill myself but at the same time I don't want to carry on living. 1. I don't think I would kill myself 2. Even though I'm meh on my family I wouldn't put them through that 3. If a truck ran me over next week my instant thought would not be ""no i have so much to live for""

I feel like I'm done with life. I don't want to carry on. I don't want to make decisions that could backfire. I don't want to make a wrong move and regret my past (although I hardly regret things). I don't want to try and get out of my funk and become social again. I've always struggled with friends, my relationships and my passions. My whole life is made up of; I want to do this  I pursue it, get so far and then for whatever reason its done - over with. I don't want to keep doing that.

Life is too much of a gamble and I just don't want to risk it. It's like a game and I'm done playing but I can't bring myself to quit. I don't enjoy playing I'd rather I naturally land on a square and go bankrupt and lose the game (monopoly). It's like I don't want to see what positives are out there I'm not ready to risk the negatives and the positives aren't enticing anymore I'd just rather not play at all. Even if someone said here's a free pass I'd rather just not do it.

There's too much unknowns in life and out of it. Does what I do with my life effect my afterlife if there even is one and ultimately do I care.

I really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this being so long I just felt like I need to put it into words and see if anyone has experienced similar things.",Depression

Hallucinations

Hi! I’ve been on Sertraline for almost a year now. On 150mg a day. I’ve been to hundreds of doctors as I keep neglecting my treatment and moving but each dr increases my dose and pushes me out the door.

Recently I’ve been having severe symptoms, I’ve been really strongly visually hallucinating. I’m not talking about like an odd shape I literally imagined the floor crumbling underneath me and was convinced I was going to drop in to hell. I saw stuff like the world look like I was trapped in a game, and lots of dark haunting scary looking people.

Leaving,1,g1zu9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1zu9w/leaving/,0,1587010658.0,"So if I kill myself then it's the worst thing ever to my family, but I'm thinking of just packing my essentials leaving my phone a driving as far as my truck goes on a tank of gas then walking. No idea where I'd walk to maybe somewhere else but I think I've hit the point where I just can't take other people telling me how I should feel and how I should live my life.
I've had depression for around 20 years now and it's just awful. I understand those who say it'll get better but when it does it's simply when is it going to go downhill again? I've been on the back and forth for years had 2 vehicles totally paid off had 2 jobs that I loved to work at, had the whole thing. But even having financial security, food, shelter, drugs, friends/family. None of it has ever made me happy.
We live in a society that says we need things, people, drugs, or a certain outlook to have a happy life.
I don't want to be here anymore, I feel abused. Like I can never be myself because everyone has built up a perception of me and when I act like myself I'm ridiculed for being different or told that's not how it works or you can't feel that way.
The problem is I do feel this way and I always have, it's gotten to the point where I believe my own thoughts to be cancerous even if they make me feel better because I've been led to believe I have to be someone and something I just am not and every day I have to pretend that I'm ok and love this shit just feels like I'm slowly suffocating my real self.

I've gotten to the point over the last 3-4 months where I'm trying to die. I've pretty much stopped eating fruit in hopes vitamin deficiency will kill me. I try to avoid protein to just waste my muscles away. I've started only drinking alcohol and refusing to intake water, I've had 5 glasses in 2 weeks, just in hopes my kidneys shut down. I've even been trying to smoke cigarettes, which I fucking hate, just because I want to do damage to my lungs and have had asthma so I know they are getting fucked.

I feel like if I just leave this life behind, not suicide, then I could possibly become the person who I have always wanted to be. So i either can slowly watch myself rot and pretend to be alright, which what I've done for the last 15 years, or I attempt to try again somewhere else without any past, family or friends.",Depression

I lost my mind. I saw red. And all I could think was fuck everything and fuck everyone. 

My best friend suffered a tragedy beyond words in December. The father of her unborn child and her partner hung himself. She was 8 months pregnant and found him in their brand new house, had to take him down and give him
CPR While he died in her arms. It’s been traumatizing. I have had conversations with her that have been more heartbreaking than most things I’ve heard in life. 

Easter Sunday we’re all having a great morning and my sister brings up that she’d like to give my friend at $250 target gift card to help. My dad out of nowhere says “$250? That’s some bullshit.” Everyone was stunned. no one said anything until I spoke up and said “why is that bullshit? To help my best friend whose struggling really bad right now and is so depressed and sick that she is on short term disability bc she’s not ready to go back to work. Then to save face in front of everyone, he started to lie. Just straight lie and act like he had no idea who jasmine was (he’s met her several times she’s been my friend for over a decade) tried to act like he had no idea about the situation (completely lies. He knew everything about it. He was there when I went to the funeral and asked a bunch of questions and I cancelled a lot of things during this time to support her) and made me look like a crazy person for being upset.

Mind you- my dad and I have had a strained relationship for awhile. My husband and I have been living in my parents basement for a year to try to save and he has made servers really fucked up comments besides this one- called me a fucking asshole bc I questioned something he said Under his breath about me and yelled a berated me in front of my husband. Has been rude to my husband. Made snide remark after snide remark to the point where I’m completely anxious to even do upstairs or be around him bc he’s just mean. 

My mom and I have always been close. She didn’t say anything to him during this incident. And basically said to me after I got upset “shut up. I am trying to enjoy my Easter.” Okay yeah bc I wasn’t trying to enjoy my Easter right ? This morning I made an order at a wine store and she went off on me telling me that I haven’t asked her if she’s wanted anything from any stores when we’ve gone out and basically calling us selfish. Let me be clear- I’m about the least selfish person ever. And I forgot to ask 1 time. We have been out of the house maybe 5-6 times total and I sent her screen shots when I and my husband have asked her if she needed anything. I just couldn’t believe she has the nerve to call me selfish after all this had gone down and I haven’t heard a word from her or my dad about Sunday. No apologies. Nothing. 

So I lost it. Everything came to a head. I am in so much pain and have been for over a decade. I take meds daily. I see my psych and therapist regularly. I try so hard to better myself and be a good person, daughter, sister, wife everything and everyone just seems to want to shit on me. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know what I ever did to deserve this. I feel like I was born by mistake. My sisters never get shit. Literally never. My oldest sister can basically do no wrong- yet I’m supposed to be having a wedding in 5 months and she hasn’t done a damn thing or asked anything about it and she’s supposedly one of my maid of honors. 

I first took 6 of my pills and then cut my arm with my razor. Not too deep and not too near my veins. I am so ashamed of myself. It’s been a really really long time since I’ve done that. The pain I felt. Watching it bleed. It just made me
Want to keep going and brought back all
The trauma I’ve had in my life. All the pain I stuff down every day and have for years. I am in so much pain and still no one cares. I’m just the brunt of everyone’s bullshit. And all I can think about it wanting to end it all. I love my husband so much and my two cats but the pain is so deep that sometimes I don’t even think about how their lives would be effected if I died. And he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand the pain. 

I’ve bandaged my arm. 6 pills were not enough to do anything but make me really tired and numb to my emotions- I did email my doctor. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I just need a hug. I need someone to tell me that I’m not crazy and that I have a right to be upset and feel hurt. My feelings do matter. That my life is important. I tried to text my mom that I wanted to die and she basically got more mad at me and gave me an ultimatum to talk or not and then continued to say I was ridiculous for wanting to die bc she got mad at me about the grocery order. She knows good and well that was just the straw that broke the camels back in my current depression. 

Sorry for the ramble. I just needed to vent. I needed someone out there to here me. Someone to let me know it’ll be okay.

I'm currently on 20mg Fluoxetine (10 wasn't enough) and I'm starting to feel completely worthless. The only thing I have going for me is that I still live with my mom, but all i can find happiness in doing is playing video games. Even with the current events and circumstances, I can't make myself get out of bed to work on online homework. I struggle everyday of my life to find motivation to do anything, and I don't know what to do anymore. Starting to feel like nobody needs me here. If you have any advice on what keeps you motivated and what makes you get out of bed everyday, please share. Thanks for reading if you made it to the end.",Depression

I dont want to play or interact with the kids. I just dont care. I want to care... but my brain doesn't care.

I dont care about my wife anymore. The love I had when marrying her is long gone.

I dont want to do the enormous pile of dish washer loading and unloading 4 times a day because she keeps eating and never cleaning up afterwards.

I dont want to empty and hang up clothes and load the washer twice a day because they keep making a mess.

What I want is to either be totally separated from them and just pay the child support for 18 years, and completely independent and on my own.

I miss the days where I could wake up on a day off whenever the fuck I wanted to. I could game for hours on end and have fun with buddies online.

I used to go out to bars with work buddies or my entire work department and have a great time after a week of work, chat up the ladies, just enjoy life.

I fucking hate being at home. I look forward to work every single day now. I'd rather be there working and away from my family.

But on the flip side.. I feel an insane amount of guilt and anger with myself for feeling like this. It would be a lot easier to just fucking kill myself.

I most of the time rather be dead than do the separation option because Its selfish and awful of any man to do that to someone and still be alive living their life while the ex wife does all the heavy lifting alone knowing that her partner just up and left and didn't give a shit.

At least if I'm dead she can take out her anger on the fact that at least I'm dead and not out there living, which would make her feel worse.

I'm so fucking tired... tired of the hallucinations, the meds that dont work, regularly overdosing my meds trying to get them to work cos I cant see a shrink anymore thanks to covid, waking up feeling like I've been bashed in the face with a hammer every day while my daughter is yanking my arm to get up and do boring shit like play with fucking toys I could not give 2 shits about, watching crappy cartoons on repeat, making her food and then she barely eats any of it so what's the fucking point, all while trying to stand up with a head that feels like it's been blown off.

I'm tired of everyone. I'm tired of my dickhole parents always trying to keep in contact when I've made it clear I dont wanna know them anymore. I'm tired of hearing that the distant family members are sending me messages to say hi when I haven't spoken to them for years since they traumatised me and fucked me over.

I'm tired of trying to get in touch with another friend who regularly thinks of ending his life and trying to calm him down, tired of trying to keep in touch with childhood buddies who just up and abandoned talking to me when I moved.

FUCKING TIRED. I just wanna live like Jimmy in the Wire. Shithole apartment with one room and a mattress on the floor and my smartphone and maybe a TV. Bag of clothes in the corner. Eat when I'm out. Drink lots. Smoke weed or do some drugs. Go to titty bars, and if I cant do that.... fuck it, I'm jumping. Everyone in the world... humanity... go fuck yourself.

I've always been an optimist, all my life I've always tried to look for the bright side of things. And it's the same way now, sometimes I convince myself.

And how I always felt like shit, I remember all the ""friends"" I used to have that would call me ugly and ignore everything I did, and just laughed at my face. I remember my ex and the abuse I went from her and how no one supported me, ever.

But I don't want to be depressed, I know I sound like an asshole but I think suicide is about the dumbest thing you can ever commit. Why kill yourself when your already gonna die? Why not live life to the fullest and let death come naturally? 

But even though I have those thoughts there is always that other voice in my head. A voice that you can barely hear, you'd have to really listen to be able to hear it. It keeps telling me to kill myself over and over again it says, what's the point in being alive when no one likes you, when all your friends hate you. Your a nobody, stop being alive.

On most days I can barely hear the voice I ignore it, but then there is those days where I wake up and cry and it's like the voice had climbed over the thousands of walls I've put up and its shot the thousands of little guards that I call rational thought.

I used to have a pretty bad problem with cutting which is why I stopped for so long, but today, other methods of hurting myself just wasn’t working.

Yet my mom and the rest of my family have always forced me to act like she was my saviour. No one likes it when I as much as try to bring up the fact that she was the one who cheated on him, she was the one who regularly left me alone with him, knowing full well he was making my life living hell.

When we left, that should've been the end of the pain. Not the ramp up; the part where the guitars start properly chugging and the LPFs are released.

And then she left. I was barely 13. She left to move to another city, because she wanted to live her life unbound by me. She wanted to date rich European men and hoe around. And that came at the cost of me being forced to spend the next 5-6 years of my life with my piece of shit paternal grandparents. Those who made clear that I was just a burden left on them unjustly.

All of this is a tiny, tiny, tiny part of my story, but it bears mentioning/ranting. I still fantasise about ripping and tearing my dad, sure, but no matter what I still have nothing but resentment for my mom. And considering I'll never be in a romantic relationship (not by choice), therapy and medication simply never worked for me in the 5 years I did try it, and emotionally fulfilling friendships over the web only go so far... There's really nothing left. Is there?

Maybe I'm the real villain here, and I just need to shut up.

There's this friend that I have that I talk to quite often online through discord, and we're pretty close. But I always dread talking to her because of how she treats me. It's near impossible to get my point across on anything without her interrupting or changing the subject. Whenever I say something to intend one thing, she'll take it as another thing (if that makes sense) and she'll usually try to always one-up me in our conversations. Last night she talked about a little of what she struggles with, and I was there for her to comfort/support her. But when I tried to bring up myself and open myself to her, she ignored me and shot it down. She does say she hopes I can find peace or whatever, but she won't ever allow me to be myself with her (which would be really helpful) and when she talks to me, it's like she completely ignores what I tired to say. She can't ever seem to understand me when I try to talk to her, and I really want her to. And I **always** feel worse after every conversation we have.

But can any of you guys relate? Like you try your best to explain your situation to someone, and they say they're sorry or they get it. But when they try to help or give advice, it's in a completely different direction.

\----------------------

I just don't want to live. No one understands that, everyone keeps telling me shit that my life is just about to start. Like saying that my problems maybe doesn't matter because I'm young (18). I'm scared that life may be even worse than today. I've been suffering from depression for a really long time (I stopped being happy when I was 4th grade, wanted to kill myself since 6th grade). Everyone in my primary school was bullying me and telling me stuff I'm ugly, weird and sometimes they were throwing stuff at me. There was once a boy that kept kicking my legs but I don't remember exactly why. When I graduated from this school to another, the bullying just didn't stop. They were bullying me because I was poor and my family had financial problems. When I moved to another town I had strong trust issues but everything was fine. I felt like everything is about to change to better.

But it didn't.

I found my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were with each other for almost 2 years. I felt loved and I would do then everything for him just to feel loved. I was very jealous of him. Something like yandere tbh but I don't think so, I just wanted to be with him forever and show everyone that I can be in relationship (I remember when one of girls from my class in primary school told me that I'm so ugly and disgusting that even a pedophile wouldn't touch me). So I did. Until he started insulting me in a very vulgar way but mostly he called me ""a fucking ameba"". He also started to be nice to me but only when we had sex. I couldn't satisfy him when I tried to pleasure him. He was also trying to flirt with my lesbian acquaintance. In front of me. Many times. I didn't want to end this relationship because I thought that I will never find a partner again and I will be forever alone. But I finally decided after all this long time of pain. I told him to fuck off. I cried for a long time but for now I just feel disgusting that a person like him has touched my body. No worries, he never raped me nor molested me. I just feel bad that someone like him touched me.

After some months I went to the mental hospital because I was feeling really suicidal. I've been here for about 3 weeks. People were bullying me there because I was annoying to them and one girl even told me that I should just kill myself and everyone will be happy. They were laughing at me because ""I couldn't handle the truth"". My mom took me out from there even though my doc wanted to keep me for two weeks more. Yes, she knew what was happening to me during my stay in this stupid hospital.

When I was there someone from my classmate's discord told me they can keep me company during this hard time. It was my future boyfriend. We were with each other for some months. He broke up with me because he felt that he has feels for a girl that he knew for a long time. I felt sad but he never hurt me, so I decided just to let him go. I didn't want to be annoying or something.

And now we're here. Me, depressed and bored, who doesn't want to get better because I know it won't work. It never worked. And this coronavirus stuff is making me even more depressed. I wanna die but something from this virus just bugs me. I'm just... lost, ugh. Everything pisses me off.",Depression

I’m unable to live up to the standards society has placed on me. As a 22 year old male, there is obviously a lot of them. Want examples? Ok. I’m expected to be tough and never show emotions, can’t do that. I’m expected to know a lot about cars and tools and all that, I don’t know any of that. In relationships, I’m expected to “be a man” and provide for women, make all the first moves, chase after scary sounds and bugs, do heavy lifting, provide for her while she just gets to be comfortable, I definitely can’t do any of that. I’ve never even been in a relationship, as someone with high functioning autism/aspergers, dating is pretty much rigged against me, so is society as a whole really. Women are cared about and have all these people fighting for them, I wish I had people fighting for me, I matter to nobody. Women are always cared about when depressed but males are just told to man up and deal with it. I’ve always wished I was a girl. If some of that sounds sexist I really don’t care, it wasn’t, and if that’s how you took it that’s too bad. I don’t have the strength, mentally and emotionally to live up to these standards, never can, and I never plan to. Already planning to kill myself soon, I’m beginning to overcome my fear of death and by the end of the year I likely will. Life clearly wasn’t meant for me, and I don’t plan to stick around, especially in a world that hates me.

I haven’t taken any medication or visited my therapist since. Mainly because I swore I was finally gonna go back to college but never did. I was too ashamed to go back showing I had barely any progress. Plus I stopped taking medication. I know it would help me greatly but for some reason I just don’t want to get into that funk of feeling good and I’m not sure why. Is it because I simply am to attached to being depressed? It sucks because I feel like people that start therapy and all that start making noticeable changes in only a couple months and I haven’t done jack in almost two years.

I've had (diagnosed) anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. It was not triggered by anything bad in my life, stress, or negative attitude. It was sudden. It's been theorized by some doctors that it's due to one of the many concussions I've had over my lifetime. I've tried everything from behavioral therapy and therapy sessions to almost every class of antidepressant. Yes, exercising and eating healthy too, etc. I've settled on one medication that's been the best so far. 

&#x200B;

Therapy helped for a while, but I haven't been able to find a replacement therapist that has helped. Therapy only helped me deal with the problems caused by my depression, not my depression itself.

&#x200B;

At my best, I'm a little anxious and somewhat normal, but never completely ""normal"". This is the case for 2 to 4 weeks. I then get a bout of depression that lasts 1 to 2 weeks. It is unprovoked and nothing seems to delay or prevent it, even regular exercise and healthy habits. I cannot stop it. My life is a cycle of several ""okay to good"" weeks followed by a couple of really low weeks. I tried self-medicating with marijuana for a while. It puts a damper on the tough weeks but doesn't help me continue living normally. I stopped using it.

Then if that girl became my partner and i spent time with her every day i would get a release of endorphines so i wouldnt be depressed at those times, enough endorphine released could keep you feeling stable or happy for a few hours without any activity(i think), isnt it wrong for depression to be diagnosed and treated like a mental illness?",Depression

I constantly fight with my parents for petty reasons and then I cry about it at night, I shout at them, and then regret it later. 2019 was a bad year, initially, till mid May, I was suicidal, I even put a blade to my wrist but somehow I stopped myself. I found a girl, the kindest, most beautiful girl ever, and I fell in love. But as the title suggests, I messed it up. I fell in love with her, she fell in love with me too, but I had a female friend with whom I was a little too flirtatious.

That made my girlfriend hurt herself.

Today, it has been 8 months since we started dating and one of her puppies died and I told her that I used to hurt myself because when she used to get mad and used to tell she'd rather be with ""A guy she knows"" because he wouldn't hurt her from the beginning, even though I swore never to hurt myself again. And now she doesn't want to be with me and also feels like killing herself because she hurt me, even though it is my fault and I should've told her earlier, she takes the blame on herself and doesn't want to be with me anymore. But I love her so much and she's the one person I'm never going to give up on, no matter what she says, it's either her or nobody else, now I am not trying to be toxic or manipulate her into staying with me, but I really don't want her to go, the pain of separation is way too much for me to deal with.

Dealing with depression or whatever i have.,0,g1vdc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1vdc2/dealing_with_depression_or_whatever_i_have/,3,1586997133.0,"So, i am new to reddit and i dont quite know how everything works yet, but i have been thinking about posting because i always read reddit about medications and depression/anxiety/bipolar to see others experiences and how they deal with them.

I have never been properly diagnosed. Well, I've been to many different people and i have gotten many different diagnosises: major depression, bipolar, schizophrenic. So, i have a lot of confusion within myself with my situation and its quite frustrating. It would be helpful to know whats going on with me so i could deal with what i have going on as best as possible. 

I guess im just ranting because i dont know i how to feel or what to do with anything i have going on. I feel so debilitated. On top of that i take medication, which is another annoying and confusing process within itself (having to figure what works for you and what dose works for you). I take Lamictal 400mg right now, but i dont know if thats too much because i feel like im having some cognitive issues like forgetting what im going to say mid sentence or have nothing to think of in general (very blank), but like i said very confusing because i dont know if its the medication doing that or the condition/mental illness that i deal with. Also, sexual dysfunction is THE WORST... Im 20 so this is a issue for me when it comes to medications. I never know how to feel about what im taking and when it comes to medication i am very impatient and freak out at the beginning when i start to feel all of the intial side effects. When that happens I'll self medicate and switch my dose by myself. I know this wont help anything, but ill have anxiety about it and just make a rash decision.

Sorry about the long post, but i feel like i dont have people that deal with similar issues to talk about this with. I feel like giving up a lot because i just dont know what to do anymore or how to fix myself or at least be a functional person. I've distanced myself from my friends and people i love and feel like I've ruined my relationship with my girlfriend because of the crazyness that i deal with and in turn put on other people.

this is very actually pretty fucking hard for me to talk about this and its not a good way to post it on the internet. But I have to stand my fear. My heart is beating really fast.

He bullied me 24/7 and he is one of the reason why I have depression, social anxiety etc. Im not sure how long it was all I did was trying to kick against his shinbone. But it didnt work, he just kept going. I just tried everything with my strength but I was too weak. After I dont know how long he let me go and we went back to class.

I want to kill this guy actually so bad. I remember his fucking name and if my life wont go better or just trash, I swear I will kill him, then kill myself no joke actually.

Due to some unfortunate traumatic events, I was taught at a very young age that anyone you trust can betray you and ruin your life, but somewhere along the lines, I still adapted a rather selfless personality (That isn't self-flattery). 

I have a serious problem with putting people before myself. Not so much doing favors and sacrificing my own, letting them walk all over me, but I invest all of my time thinking about my friends, partners, and family, alongside all their issues. I'm well aware that their problems aren't mine to take on, but I overthink them regardless. Same applies to my own issues, but it's much worse. Especially with the quarantine, I've been given a large amount of time to sit and think things over and over to the point of unhealthiness.

I've begun distancing myself from people, and usually that'd be a major sign to myself that things are getting bad, but it actually feels like my first step to healing. I am a very socially oriented person, and It's seriously taken a toll on me. Not to mention the fact that most of the people in my life wouldn't even put a fraction of as much thought into me as I do them. 

In an ideal situation, I isolate myself entirely from everyone, and take this time to learn how to focus on myself and bettering who I am. My only problem, however, is that I'm very back-and-forth with things (eg. leaving a partner, claiming it's for mental healing, and then coming back mere days later)  I convince myself that everybody overthinks as much as I do, and i convince myself i want that. I convince myself that I'm happy in whatever situation I'm in, and it always brings me back, no matter how terrible the scenario. 

What I feel like I need is a sign, I feel like I need something to remind me to never truly trust anybody, I need to be reminded that I never really mattered to them, because I don't. I need to push myself away from contact because somewhere through the years, I never learnt to be truest to myself. I need to be told that people leave and people die, and the only constant in my life will ever be me. I need to gain that sense of selfness that I'm sure could better me as a person.

I joined when I was 17 and I worked so hard to try to show everyone that I was good enough to be a Marine. In the end, I was just another cog that was continuously grounded down until it was time to replace me. All those years of being told that I was worthless have bled into my life post-military. 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the past five years. I've seen several therapists, most of them dismissing my case as a minor case. I've been suicidal only once after I attempted to end it with a gun in my mouth. My vice became alcohol and its wondrous ways of allowing you to forget the pain, even if it's temporary. 

When my son was born, all that changed. My days are brighter now with the newfound purpose of being a dad. I don't drink that often anymore and seeing my son's smile helps me forget my pain better than any bottle ever could. 

But, when he's not there, I still fight to keep my demons at bay. I can hear them clawing in the back of my mind, telling me that everyone's life would be better off with me dead. My life insurance would help my spouse have a home, it'd pay for my son's college, and set my parents and brother up for a long stretch of time. I've thought about it so many times.

I was confused cause noone talked about it with me.

We had a bond which was tighter than the one I have with my parents. I'm not able to sleep at night. I actually fear going to sleep (dark thoughts come across my mind). 

I miss here so so terribly. She was young just 24. The achiever within the family while I still struggle in college. It should have been me. I try to be brave for my parents. But they too are too broken to recover. It's too much. 

I can't go on. I don't see it ever getting better.
It's just too much. Too much... 

It's 3 in the morning.
And the demons have returned.
In my mind I hear a warning.
But it is too late to run.

I want to scream and thrash.
But I'm tied me to the bed.
A tear rolls down my cheek.
Signaling my spirit to be dead.

A calmness comes over me.
I find comfort in the inevitable.
But then images of my family float.
And thus starts the trouble.

I'm at crossroads, not sure what to do.
Had you been here, I wouldn't be feeling so blue.

I make up my mind.
Far too long have I suffered.
Over the table lies the tiny escape.
It will be quick, it will be painless.
I say as my heart starts to flutter.

I close my eyes, letting the deed take it's course.
There's no turning back I say.
It's time to jump across.

It's 3 in the morning
Finally will I sleep
And when I meet you in the light,
shall I smile and weep",Depression

I can mostly control it but every few years that fire burns too much for me to handle. When that happens people around me get hurt. I’ve been to therapy but that never helped. All therapy does is teach you how to bury that anger. It never teaches you how to control it. That I learned myself. I learned to focus that in things like the gym or in arguments. I occasionally use it to hurt people that deserve it. But recently I’ve stopped going to the gym because of my depression. And due to the corona virus there’s no ways for me to use my anger productivity.

and all that got me thinking of how much my life is ruined now and beyond fixing because my father was doing what he wanted all the time. usually it was drinking and trying to hit the jackpot. he spend all his life being given things, so he wanted to be rich easly too. except... then he would waste it all to get drunk. and its been always like that, aside from threats about killing my mom flying around the house, broken plant pots, plates and other stuff. he chilled now but im still here stuck with him.

and i cant even think of what i lost because of him. my childhood, my possible friendships, my possible romance, my holidays and vacations, my education, three years wasting away at home and then another three of wasting away and *sometimes* going to shit job that i hate with horrible pay. and all this is still continuing and i cant start living because lol... for what money

i cant even have good paying job because im hs dropout. i dont have driving license either. i started the course to get it two years ago but i didnt pass two exams and quit trying... thats pretty telling about me

This will be a slightly long post, so I will understand if you do not read all the way through. 

I am an international student who has previously applied to the United States for further education, along with scholarships in my home country. The results were abysmal - I got rejected from 6 out of the 8 universities which I applied to, had to rescind one offer because I couldn't supply my finances in time and got accepted into one. I've had no luck on the scholarship front either. 

I've not been taking this news well at all. I was really harbouring great dreams to go to the US to study music, and it feels like my dreams have all been smashed. I genuinely thought I had a chance of getting in to the schools I wanted, but now it feels like reality has delivered the verdict, and the truth of it is I simply haven't accomplished as much with my life as I thought I did. It feels like all I've done has amounted to nothing. 

A good majority of my close friends did manage to get into reputable overseas universities, and I can't help feeling left out and utterly inferior to them. I can't socialise with other people now without constantly being reminded of my own inability to achieve things. They say that to be successful you ought to surround yourself with successful people to learn from them, but all I feel is inadequacy. 

I've also felt that my learning capabilities have become compromised. Now I feel either cynical, impatient or resigned while learning. I have no mood to learn new things and I can't help getting a feeling of, ""my time has passed, I should have done all these things during childhood,"" when picking up new skills. I get really impatient now and constantly expect quick results, which usually don't happen and end up making me even more frustrated. 

I've had depressive episodes before, but last year was really a hopeful and inspiring one because I was stepping out of my comfort zone and I was really trying to take life in new directions I hadn't gone to before. 2020 is turning out to be the antithesis of that - getting rejected feels like all I'm doing has come to naught and everything I've tried to build has been a lie. I'm sinking into a slump where every day just passes by in a blur and I don't know how to shake it off. 

This is just a bad year all-round. I'm aware that all of this has sounded like self-absorbed narcissistic whining, but I wanted to get it off my chest regardless. Thanks everyone if you've read this far, and I hope that all of you are coping well with the coronavirus quarantine yourselves.",Depression

Throughout high school, my main problem was trying to find that coveted word, online and in person, failing over and over and over. It was a passion equal to my true passion, fiction writing. 

Over the years, I've come to realize how it's pointless to waste energy on romantic love. Time and time again, I find the energy I put into that is the energy that should be veered toward actual important endeavors. 

Although the desire isn't nearly as strong as it was in high school, I still desire it and I still fear having it taken away from me, which seems to be the case now. What I realize after a post I saw on FB one day is that, I could have and can be working near my highest potential if I'd let that part of me go.

My father succumbed to cancer when I was 14 and I’m 22 now. He had it for 5 years prior and those years seemed to last decades and minutes at the same time.

I think I might be breaking up with my long term boyfriend. And I’m... pretty broken up about it. Constant, fat tears... I couldn’t stop shuddering... I was in physical pain and it felt like my chest was collapsing in on itself. The worst part about this is that he was my only friend. I literally have *no one* to talk to about this. I don’t have a support system. It was just him. I know that was unfair, but I was trying to change it. All of my friendships have fallen apart for various reasons that I had nothing to do with. I don’t feel close with my family. I didn’t mean to make him my only point of support. I guess it doesn’t matter now. I have no one to message and just talk to. Of all the people I do know, I’m not close enough to any of them to reach out. They’re not anything beyond surface level friends. It’s not their fault, or bad necessarily. They’re good people. I don’t blame them. I feel a sense of mourning. I never got to tell him that for months I have been thinking about how great it will be to put his towel in the dryer while he showers, but I didn’t want to tell him (and I’m terrible at keeping secrets) because I wanted to see the surprised look on his face. I’ll never see that now. I feel weird “mourning” the family we would have had and the life we would’ve built. Thinking about that makes me wonder if I’m making a mistake by stepping back, but talking to him right now is bringing such great emotional pain that I physically hurt. I never wanted this to happen. I was afraid something like it would. I’m realizing now that is what I’d be telling a friend if a had one. Now that I’ve slept a little and I’m sitting here... I feel this calm melancholy. My chest still hurts but I’ve stopped crying. I desperately don’t want it to be... but I think it’s over. I have this feeling, like... it’s hard to describe. I know I’ve been too much of a burden on him, and he’ll never directly tell me but being with him is too much for him and it’s hurting him. I’m hurting him by being with him because of the way I am. I question if I ever actually worked on myself... I think I did. But in hard times I have been melting a little, and I think it’s just too much. This, combined with som other crap that happened a little while ago, just makes me feel so... numb. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet to be honest. 
I love him so, so very much but the pain is just too much. Some of it isn’t his fault but I also feel like he could’ve taken a leap of faith for me, and didn’t, and I’m crushed. I thought I had shown that I would have his back, but thinking backwards in time to other conversations we’ve had, it’s clearer to me he doesn’t completely trust me for some reason and I don’t know why. His schooling means so much to me, I wouldn’t have gotten in the way of that... I would’ve done everything to help make it easy. Make help him staying here as comfortable as possible. I believed he’d want to stay, to weather this storm together... but I was wrong. Said he didn’t think it through enough. He talked to his family and they advised against it... I understand because of the circumstances... I feel like they mistrust me too... for some reason there was some perceived ill intentions in things went down... but I just wanted to see him. They said it was okay and after believing all this time he’d come be by my side, he said no. And it’s not just that he’s not here with me. He thinks I wouldn’t do everything and anything to help facilitate his success and help him thrive. I don’t know why. A long time ago, we were talking about something to do with school, and I can’t remember the specifics but he said something to effect of “I don’t trust you to not get mad at me for doing my work” or something. And I *heard* him, and I swear I wasn’t doing anything but being supportive of him going to school but he felt like I’d impede him. I was crushed then, we were sitting in my car but I made an excuse to go to the bathroom to go cry. I don’t know what I did to make him feel like he can’t trust me.... I trust him completely and it lead to my heart feeling so broken. I feel like a sore idiot for going on about being sad and “heart broken” but if you really think someone is the one and it gets messed up... I’m reeling. If I had known that the last time I saw him was gonna he the *last* time... I can’t think about it too much or I’ll just cry. I don’t really know what to say now. I tried to keep my cool so that he’d see I was trying to be responsible, and he’d see I was trying to be good. I didn’t want to lose my marbles and ask him why or be sad, I’ve ruined any chance of seeing him at all. None of this has properly sunk in. I don’t have to save my Instagram memes anymore, all of what I have saved is... just... nothing now. I’ll never get to hug him again, I can’t show him how much I care and that I’d never hurt him and that I want him to feel whole and happy... I’ll never get to live with him and warm his towels or have his beans or know what it’s like to be with him. I feel like I’m doing something rash... but there’s this weird calm... I think it has to be this way... he will be able to thrive without me, and I know he’ll be able to do his work with flying colors... I’m not worried about that. But I just feel so... lost.

My mom and dad split when I was very young 
My mom had 2 kids before me and a lie after me, all with different men and all of them bailed and left my mom with the kids(except my dad). 
She used a lot speed and gambled her way into debt and struggled alot with mental illness 
She couldn't handle everything so i moved to my dad and his new woman (I call her mom) and her daughter (my big sis) when I was 2. 
From there on I spent 1 week at my dad and then 1 week at my moms. So I was kind of the outsider of both of my families, this continued for quite a while, 2 different sides of life. 

1 week at my dads place, which was a nice smalltown with a nice daycare and school and 1 week with my mom and my now 3 other siblings (i got a new younger sister) wherever we lived at the moment ( she moved around quite a lot) 

I liked to be at my moms place, she wasnt as strict as me ex military dad but he had his reasons. But I spent my entire childhood going back and forth between two different worlds and missing out on both, not feeling like I was in center of anything, on my moms side I think I was seen with some resent for being able to live with my fancy dad and still being the most chaotic of us. And at my dads they saw me as a kid who couldn't behave. 

I was outside everywhere. Friend groups, family and just mentally alone, but god knows I tried, I tried way to hard and that fucked it up for me everytime but I tried. My parents hated eachother for so long and I was a pawn in my moms game and I ended up hating my dad for many years and I Will always hate myself for that, he was hard on me but he is a goddamn good dad and he tried. He even tried when I was a heavy drug user at 16 to 20 years old. He saw me take my older brothers (moms side) steps and he couldnt see all the mental problems I had and I don't blame him, he grew up where men didnt show that they suffered so it angered him. 

I was pretty good at masking my lonlieness with friends who liked that I did stupid shit and that I got angry easily. But Fuck I spent so many years crying myself to sleep and sleeping in the warmth of the shower. I just wanted to feel like I belonged. 
Fast forward to 2017 and many drugs and bad behaviour, my parents kicked me out and I spent a year couch surfing and sleeping rough until I met my girlfriend, half a year after my ex cheated on me with my friend and after I vowed to never trust love because I fall really easy and I have bad judgement but damn it was like the sky turned and I felt like home, I can't describe it but it felt like your soul got a warm close hug after staying at the bottom of a cold sea. All my self harm, all the cuts, all the drugs, every lonley night every single time I tried to make it over the edge of that fucking bridge, every overdose. It was all worth it and I would have done it 10 times over. She was so goddamn beautiful, and those eye man... those eyes. I would break every bone in my body just to look into those eyes and be certain that it was with love they looked back at me again.

The first mistake I made was that I went to fast, I moved in in under a month and I was blind to the signs. I know I fall for the broken type and you'd think that comes with a certain eye for when things are sketchy but no. It took me 4 months until I realised that she was cheating with multiple guys and I stood there outside the window and seeing her in panties on a guy on the couch. That was 2 years ago on the 9th of april and I'm too this day certain that a part of me died that night. I went in and picked up my stuff and went on my way to my first OD in a while. I survived. I licked my wounds for a while knowing I had to keep of the drugs I had already damaged my family, my mom my dad and my 2 angels ( my younger sisters) I couldnt get lost again, I needed them to see me happy and alive.

My girlfriend wanted me back and I couldnt walk away from that feeling I had before, even if that meant living with the old familiar feeling of never being someones number one. For a year forward I was treated like shit and still saw signs of infidelity until I caught her with more then just messages. She had been to a guys place pretty close to where we lived so I went to talk to him (She was at Home every day while I was working full time so we could survive) he told me they had met but nothing had happened, but that she had been coming on pretty strong but he didnt like her.

 I Think she was looking for a guy similar to the guy I first guy I caught her with... She would have done anything for him. It took her over a year to post that she was in a relationship with me because she was afraid what he would think. I did everything for her but he was still number one. 
Anyways... 

I confronted her and she told me she loved me now, forreal and she had problems and wanted to change so she changed (or cleaned up her act) and she worked on herself and slowly began to treat me better. But it never felt like she's really attracted to me like she had been to other guys, even then when really hot women came onto me I never gave or give anyone a single signal. Instead I'm always there for my baby, when she is down i leave work and come Home, when we fight and she turns it around to be my fault I say Im sorry, and its slowly killing my self respect. And now 2020 its much better between us and I have my son (my dog) who means the world to me and my family is so proud of me and everyone turns to me with their problems cause its easy to talk to me and I understand them but I'm so fucking lost, I'm a guy but why does noone hug me when Im down, why do a man have to ask his woman to go an extra mile to pick him up. Why is a man seen as annoying when he is needy? Why do only girls deserve romantic gestures that solidify what love someone have for them. Im so tired of being ashamed for being down and sad, for crying and not being able to pick myself up and be happy. Why don't I deserve to feel like I know where home is? I cant see a home in the world as it is and it breaks me every single day to wake up with this feeling, being surrounded by people but feeling like the lonliest man alive, deattached from everyone. I cant even sleep and find peace cause there are the nightmares and sleep paralysis waiting and the sleeping meds are a joke, the therapist meetings just makes me feel more alienated. I'm just so fucking lost

Had the cyst removed and got my tubes tied. (January). The recovery from surgery was 4-6 weeks.  I don't heal quickly so it took me about 8 weeks to feel fully healed.

I graduated from Uni at the top of my class, two years ago and had a promising future. But my life got messy as soon as I graduated; From a successful, sociable person, a person whom people cherish and appreciate and love, I've become different at 180 degrees.

1. My mom got sick, was hospitalized for two months and I moved to here home to help her. Than she moved back and I needed to stay for another couple of months until the goverment gave her someone to care of her.
2. I was diagnosed with chronic depression (my problem is not the diagnosis but the consequences of it: now my medical records are stained and I will probably not be able to get private medical insurance, take a mortgage and buy a home and have to declare in any workplace that requires a medical confidentiality waiver that I have depression) .
3. I made a mistake and admited to psycaetrist that I smoked cannabis and other things a few years ago and now its registered fact at my medical record. And now i'm afraid that i will have to addmit it to insurance companies and employers for the rest of my life.
4. I thought I took a short break to help my mom and she recovered but I got lost.

I had a very promising future, a bachelor's degree, honors, volunteerism, a good past, I had the qualities of a leader, and I could live a good, good life. I come from a very poor family and I was hoping I could get out of poverty. I am afraid of my future, my parents will have nothing to bequeath to me, my parents live on rent and I am afraid that if my life goes on I will be an aging homeless and without a wife and children and I am anxious for the future.

 All my life, I took care of myself and built myself without the help of anyone. With money no one could help me or help me, only I promoted myself and was proud of myself for it.

I already want to find a job and develop a career, but I am ashamed of my last two years. How do I explain that I did not work and was unemployed for 2 years! Whole 24 months? How do I protect myself? I'm very worried because I don't think any self-respecting institution will take a 30-year-old who hasn't worked for two years? I would be happy to advise.",Depression

I'm just a ball of hate, frustrated of everything because I hate my life and myself, , I hate being like that but this is anorched deep within me and I feel like I can't change, I had some friends (not a lot...) when I was in High school, but I just kept a few of them, and now I'm at university, I'm 20 and I can't really make new friends, I guess it's because I'm too toxic, I'm a loner so I wouldn't probably go out with them but just knowing that some people like me would give me a little bit of self-confidence, but I guess I'm too bad of a person to have friends which is the main problem here.

1- I don't care about isolation, I tend to be a lone wolf anyways, not having to deal with people in person is fantastic.  


2- I'm very very very close to putting a bullet in my skull. So here in Canada we have something called EI ( employment insurance ) and CERB.   


I've spent the better part of Oct onwards (Until around March) being unable to work due to a shoulder and ankle injury. I went into Jan telling myself that I can finally work again and not starve myself each month, then all this bs hit.  


Now because I didn't work, I'm not eligible for either the CERB or EI. Ditto for 100's in my situation, students etc.   


3- I've lost track of how many things I've punched this last few weeks. I know my knuckles are bruised up and me usually being civil and patient and friendly, has gone off the deep end and is about ready to put said bullet in my head.

I've noticed a lot of differences between 15 year old me & 19 year old me. I know as we grow up our perceptions, views & thoughts also tend to change, but I don't think mine falls into that category of 'change'.

 When I was younger, I was very ambitious, confident, determined & I knew what I wanted. Now, it's the exact opposite. I don't want to do anything, I don't have any interests and I can't help but think how meaningless life is & how much I hate being the person I am. I just feel like I don't deserve the life I have, it's too good for someone like me to live it. I always feel like a burden to people & I feel like everyone hates me (not that anyone ever said anything). I feel like they just treat me well because they're stuck with me & there's nothing they can do about it.


My brother had studied psychiatry & he was the one whom I could talk to openly. However, he told me not to label myself under those big words. So I have stopped talking to him about it.


 A day won't pass without thinking about death & how everything would've been better if I had never existed. I used to beat myself up, but I have stopped cause my body is now used to the pain. Also, I can't feel sympathy nor empathy anymore. I don't miss anyone, I don't love any one, the only emotions I feel are anger & disappointment. So it's hard for me to connect with people & I'm very isolated, like I get introvertion but mine has passed the line, I couldn't even attend my brother's wedding cause I was afraid to do something stupid & embarrass him & afraid of people judging me. On top of that, whenever I feel a tiny bit happy I feel guilty cause I feel like a loser like me doesn't deserve to be happy. 


So please let me know if there's something wrong with me or I'm fine & just making this up. Cause I genuinely can't tell if this is really happening to me or it's all in my head. Is this normal or I'm just overreacting?",Depression

Finding me!",1,g1qgqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1qgqn/warning_novel_of_doom_ahead_finding_me/,2,1586980324.0,"Since birth i was given away, the only girl to my mother. She kept my brothers. I was raised with different types of people, family, to strangers & even friends. It was horrible! My upbringing was AWFUL, mentally, emotionally, sexual abuse, abused.  Nobody loved me. I ended up with my 1st child @ the age of 16. I didn't know what I was doing, thought I was in love forever, til he cheated on me when our son was 3 months old! I threw him out of my life & moved on to an unstable mother & found another guy to love, I gave birth to our daughter. Her father was crazy, abused me most times well pregnant, ran away from him with my kids @ the age of 17. His family took me to court for my son & our daughter, they spoke lies about me, they wanted me to stay with the crazy son. They found me & my kids were ripped away like a lit match stick! I'm more lost than anything at this point, I'm trying to do right for me but everytime I failed because I didnt care no more. Drinking & smoking weed made me happy, help drown out the pain! 2yrs later I'm 19yrs old, I met a guy who's 16yrs old. I couldn't help but make myself known to his presence @ a course we both attended. We eventually made out & stuck together for 10yrs & in that 10yrs we had 5 kids. My life had changed dramatically from LOST to settled, I gave birth to his 1st child but my 3rd. After hrs in labour, we had him for 30mins till his passing, the most difficult part of my life. Losing a child in my opinion is worse than the abuse & rape I've had to endure. A week after his passing, the father had gone back to work, he didnt cry or realize he had gone. 1st day @ work he was hospitalized, fell from a 2 story building shattering his right arm. After all of this, he started to abuse me so bad, I still stayed with him & gave birth to the rest of his 5. He was in & out of jail constantly for abuse, I was having to deal with Child Youth & Families until 1 day they we're uplifted because I let him back into our lives knowing he was abusive & a high risk to almost killing me so many times. I put my kids at risk, even with drinking around them. I've never known what LOVE or how to trust the person you love. I'm very hidden with how I can start something out of nothing, the jealousy towards another female or anyone getting close to the one I love is A NO. My upbringing I blame for that. After them been uplifted in 2014, I'm definitely drowning in SHIT, don't care for nothing or myself. He ends up in jail a few months later, 2yrs he's doing. I'm on the outside waiting for him like a dumb cunt, in 2016 I found someone on facebook. Wasnt looking for love, he was someone that attended the same school as me back when I was 13. We end up talking little bits, he started to get at me on a daily its unbelievable how I'm here 5yrs later with him lol. He's born on the same day as the one in jail, in different years. We're also 3 days apart on our birthdays. He came across as a narcissist, It was unbelievably difficult for me. I found so much connection to this guy, I couldn't let go. He was not my type but the bond was strong. He has a daughter, I've never been in a relationship with a guy who had a child, so it took a toll on me to accept it. The fact I had to make room for someone that he showed a huge amount of love for, made me feel jealous. After spending time with her, I started to accept her more, I actually loved been there for her because I didnt have any of my own kids with me. She gave me hope to motivate myself to see my kids. 3yrs into our relationship we had a son my 8th child! His daughter went to live with her mother, it's best she did, she was depressed with us. I couldn't be that mother figure to her cos she loved her own mother. Today is the 15th of April 2020, my eldest boy will be 18 this month. My 8th child has autism, I'm still with his father. I'm 34 turning 35 in August this year, I'm heavily depressed, never spoke to anyone about my troubled life. Drunk it away, laughed it off & forgave so many that did me wrong. I suffer from anxiety attacks, I feel as if I'm slowly dying. I'm too young to die & I have so many things I want to do as a individual women, I'm highly motivated but I know my partner will feel insecure about me wanting to get out there on social media. I gave up smoking in October 2019, never have I quit smoking before thanks to my major ANXIETY ATTACK! I've also cut back on drinking, thanks to my trip to the hospital with a liver issue. Now I'm plain, with so many things I want to do. I have low self esteem due to weight gain, my confidence has stepped up to 60% my inside though feels tired, for years I lost my purpose & myself. These last few months I've been searching for me, I've found bits & pieces. I don't want to waste anymore of my life doing what others want of me or giving others what I think they want! I get to see all my children (heart is relieved) reducing stress. Lazy, which is a good thing, I suffered & still suffer from OCD. I have major health issues but tests say I'm healthy. It could be my mind overthinking. I'm praying someone or anyone could talk to me & tell me it's ok. I often think of the homeless & all those suffering in other countries that are asking for miracles. If I had any kind of high power, I'd definitely do my best to save as many as I can. Its who I am as a person, caring for others even if they committed a crime I can't hate. I pretend to be tough out there but hurting any living thing breaks my heart. I hate that I can't hate the people who raped me, it makes me hate myself so much. I'm a follower but I know deep down i can be a good leader, if I found who I am. Thanks for letting me share my NOVEL of doom. Never shared a briefing of my life before with strangers! Oh well I feel it may help since I couldn't speak to a counselor due to my anxiety attacks.",Depression

Depression. It’s a bitch.

I’ve always been ashamed of my depression. I’ve always tried to hide it behind smiles and jokes. It made me feel better momentarily. But I always ended up feeling alone because I had no one that knew the real me. And I’m tired of that. It took a lot of courage saying this, and even more courage to get help. But thanks to the wonderful people supporting me I’m able to stand strong. Starting today, I’m going to be living fully and un-apologetically me. It took me a long way to get here...

I don't know...

I don't know. Sometimes I know and other times I'm not really sure. Is this whole thing just fake? Did my brain create this story for me to believe so that I can feel some sense of certainty, or that I can feel that I'm 'special' and people should pity me? Do I cut only so I can think ""only someone with depression would hurt themselves on purpose, right? So I must have depression, right? Right?"". is it lying to me, like everyone says it does? Sometimes I'm happy, briefly, and then it reminds me of everything and my smile fades. No one notices, though. But those were genuine smiles. So I can't have depression if im smiling, right? If I felt happiness? Oh, someone did notice. They asked me if I was sad, and trapped and scared in the moment, I said ""no one will ever know..?"" stupid. Fucking stupid. I didn't want to lie but I couldn't say the truth. I'm such an idiot. That's literally such a stupid thing to say. And then my dad noticed. Trapped me in my room and asked if I was OK. I said ""yeah, I'm fine, I'm always like this."" so stupid. But I didn't know if I have depression, so what if it turned out that I didn't and people laughed at me and judged me and called me a crybaby and a wimp behind my back? I'm only 13, so I have nothing to worry about right? Nothing to be sad about? It would destroy me. Because it's true. And that's what hurts. I don't know who I am, what I'm supposed to do. Just school, and feeling nothing. Wake up, stress. Go to bed, emptyness. No emotion. Just stress. Brief happiness. Sadness. Self-hatred. The feeling of being lost. I want to cry but if I do people will hear me. Fuck. I'm a wimp. A loser. No one actually likes me, how could they? WHY would they? So many questions. No answer. I'll never get answers. It'll constantly be this feeling of being trapped. A cycle. No motivation, but I have to act OK, otherwise they'll give me that piteous look and ask me questions I don't want to answer. Because if I don't have depression, they'll hate me and say I just want attention. They'll hate me more than they already do. But I laugh, so I'm okay. Right?

Music that hits hard when we are down and why we listen to it,7,g1pee7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1pee7/music_that_hits_hard_when_we_are_down_and_why_we/,2,1586975225.0,"Hey everyone,
I'm someone struggling with depression since five years and have been lurking in this sub since a year or so. I've figured I won't be able to help anyone since I'm busy enough with my own thoughts, but I might as well post something interesting on here. Depression is a disease that tends to affect people with above-average intelligence, due to the fact that smarter people often overthink and/or start questioning themselves, life or even existence itself. 
I made a playlist and wondered why are we so obsessed with sad music, when listening to happy music would be the most logical thing to do. 
For anyone interested, my playlist consists of sad songs I listen to when times are difficult.
Link:
 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVw

First of all I gotta say that music is not a cure for depression and can even affect you in a negative way. The Playlist is just somthing I wanted to share.

So. Why do we like sad music?

When we listen to music we feel understood. We can see a glimpse of ourselves in the artist or song, that conveys the same emotions we feel. We feel better about our situation when we believe that someone else has experienced something similar and understands exactly how we feel. More importantly it validates our thoughts and makes us feel human and normal. At the same time, it allows listeners to bring their own negative emotions to the surface and vent them out, thereby reducing tension and stress.

Why do we hate listening to happy music?

As stated above, happy music would be the first logical thought at first, but often we do end up feeling worse than if we hadn't listened to happy songs. The best way to put it would be to compare both happy and sad with humans. The sad one is the understanding one who went through the same and is trying to console you, while the happy one is a annoying guy who always smiles at us and tells us to just cheer up and be happy.

Why do we like sad songs even when we're not sad?

Who in their right mind would choose a song that could heavily mess with their mood when there are happy alternatives out there?
Simply put is happy music often boring and fake. We as humans can't feel happiness for a extended period of time and get annoyed after a few songs.
Sad music is more moving and we connect to sad, romantic or even angry topics.

Effects of sad music on us:

""One might suppose that people become pessimistic when they’re sad; however, one research study proves that people are actually more realistic when they’re sad. This is due to a phenomenon called depressive realism. Compared with happiness, sadness has been observed to encourage more detail-oriented thinking and less judgment bias in people. Listening to sad music is believed to induce depressive realism, encouraging more realistic assessments of the likelihood of certain outcomes.""

I hate School,1,g1o3un,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1o3un/i_hate_school/,4,1586968733.0,"I hate school

So I randomly started thinking about when I was in Year 7 ( In UK, currently Year 10). But anyway I have low functioning autism which sucks incredibly( I’ll get onto that later), so I had been at this pretty good school that worked you pretty hard and the week before half term I was basically just talking with my new friend of about 2 months, and we were just joking around on the bus when I lightly slapped him on the face, anyway I thought nothing of it and we continued talking until we got to school. When we got there though a Year 12 I think came up to me and said why did you hit ____, which I was confused by and basically just went to class. Later in the second class of the day the lower school headmaster( or whatever weird title he had) came in and took me out of class, and I was completely confused, but he said that _____ had gone to the nurses with a red mark on his face( he wasn’t in my class btw) which I knew was total bullshit as I hardly touched his face but then as I have low functioning autism it basically means I lose complete function over my body and I said I wanted to kill myself and the teacher was complete shit at handling it.

Fast forward a few months and I basically developed anger management, depression, etc. and I was still at the school getting in for about 2 hours a week and feeling like utter crap. 

Then just before the first Christmas of Year 7 and I moved to another school which was honestly great, I mean I had loads of friends (actually good friends this time) and I was seeing a counsellor at the school and I felt slightly better about myself. Then after two months the counsellor, who was fully confidential, literally reported my dad to the local council as he was mentally abusive to me and I needed to tell someone so I told them, so thanks to that shit show I lost all confidence in that school and moved on.

I then had a few day trials at schools and did a month on an online school which was terrible.

Then in the Easter term of Year 8 I went to another school, for a term long trial, and I enjoyed that again and it was ok apart from the end of term when it felt like no one cared about me and I basically just walked out one day ( because I wanted to go home so I went to the office were they were supposed to call my mum, they refused and so for pretty much 2 hours I sat on the sofa by the office until I just couldn’t be fucked and left) then on that same my mum went for a meeting and the school said they wouldn’t take me back next year and I cried and was incredibly depressed for about a week.

I’ve now found a tiny collage with 6 people in a class that’s literally meant for me as I was the first student there, and while it has its ups and downs it pretty good and I’ve actually been at one school for almost two years.

Honestly though just thinking about how one person saying that I punched them has basically ruined 3 years of my life and possibly will affect my adult life, it just makes me annoyed and depressed which is why I felt I had to get it out of my system.

We became sort of close the past 2 years. But I never got to say I forgive you. Never gave him a hug without feeling awkwardness now I find myself crying every time I remember all the promises we made together and knowing he isn't opening our house door anymore. He wasn't the best father in the world but he was the only father God gave me. I tried to be his friend...he was so lonely and I felt sad for him. His actions made no one want to get close to him but I felt bad for him even if for years I resented him...I always felt bad. I miss him.

A cop stopped me from killing myself last night,308,g1njdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1njdn/a_cop_stopped_me_from_killing_myself_last_night/,21,1586965881.0,"A bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. I just feel like I have nothing and no one to live for. I’ve been really struggling lately. The people I count on to come and talk to when I feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so I’ve stopped bothering texting them. The only girl I’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. So I stopped texting her as well. No one bothers checking on me so why should I reach out to them? My aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. And my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. I was seeing a therapist but stopped because I couldn’t afford it. They care more about money than the health of their clients. America summed up in one sentence I guess. 

I dropped out of engineering school in October after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because I just didn’t wanna do it anymore. I was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. I may or may not go back. My student loans are due starting in June which I can’t afford. I have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that I never wanted in the first place with money that I don’t have. I only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which I much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. I just absolutely fucking hate being told what I can and can’t do with my own damn car that I pay for 100% myself. My car is my therapist and my favorite thing that I own. I’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. I cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. It’s been a month since quarantine and I can’t really even leave my house. Can’t have a social life. Just feel like I have no one to turn to and I’m drowning. Every fucking day and I’m just done. 

I left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. I waited til my family had all gone to bed, then I got in my car and just took off. I drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. I eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. I got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone I felt. I was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when I heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. I knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. I just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. He approached with a flashlight and noticed me. Apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. He was a young guy, probably about my age. He asked for my license and registration which I gave him. I’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and I think he picked up on the fact that I seemed a bit off. He asked me how I was doing and what I was doing so far from home at this time of night. It was like 1 am at this point. I just said that I needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually I admitted that I had driven up here to kill myself. 

I thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. He asked why and what was going on in my life. He even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. I had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how I felt like I had no one. He didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. I eventually said I planned to drive my car off this cliff because I was so unhappy. He was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. Apparently he came close to suicide a few times. A quote he said really stuck with me. It was “Sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” And it hit me that that was exactly how I felt. He gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if I needed to talk. We sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. It was so nice to just vent to someone. 

Eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what I just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. He walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. He walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. He followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while I got on the entrance ramp. I drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. I never even got his name or badge number. 

I got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. I snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. I gave no indication to my family that I tried suicide the night before. No one knew that I went out last night. I still haven’t told them and I don’t plan to. They have no idea that I could’ve died. I called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. He texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. I have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. Everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. 

It’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, I don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. His compassion saved my life. It’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. He deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. I owe him my life. Cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. We wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. I don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. I could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. Not a bad idea. Godspeed officer. I’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.",Depression

I'm gonna make a part 2 as well. 

&#x200B;

My first mistake was learning to speak, if only I were born a mute. 

I got used to being made fun of that I started to do it normally in my mind.

My brain is so broken that negativity is my one and only normal.

Talentless and below average in a sea of those who will always be better than me. 

One mistake can lead to others that feel like a slight burn. I'll continue to make them until I'm completely engulfed in flames.

Yesterday was great. Too bad those days are so rare. 

My feelings are toys to be played with and then forgotten after some amount of time. 

My mood is bound to change in an instant to negativity so that I may be comfortable. 

Do I conform so easily to others opinions or do I take bits and pieces from others? Either way, they never feel like my own.

I want to satisfy those at my own dissatisfaction. 

Why are we cursed with lives of self-doubt, contradicting, and hateful thoughts?

Wanting to always be right about failing, I will sabotage myself if doing well or flat out refuse. What a disgusting creature I am.

Why is that whenever I'm happy, depressing, and negative thoughts come by the multitude? Like a woodpecker at a tree, they pick at my brain until they're in and settled. 

Suicidal ideation was once my full time job. 

I want to say I'm sorry and that it's all my fault, although I'm not quite sure what for.

We're all hypocrites to some degree or another. 

A time for everything, but mine has been mostly sadness. 

To believe I was once complete and not broken into tiny little pieces. 

Don't hate me. I already hate myself. 

After wanting to change for so long, it's finally here. Now that it is, I want nothing more than for it to go away. 

I was never the lion like I wanted to believe. I'm the dog in the corner, whimpering and cold, only wanting to love and be loved back. 

I can look past others deformities but not my own. 

I can forgive everyone. I just can't forgive myself. 

Instead of overcoming my problems, I succumb to them. I want to blame someone for that. But everytime I look for that person, I end up looking in the mirror.

Never improving. Always failing. The essence of who I am.",Depression

I just did both the worst and best thing I have done in a long time. 10 months ago I met a girl. I uave never had a better relationship with anyone ever. We never dated, we were just good friends. However, I did develop feelings for her, in fact, she is the first person I've ever been in love with. I had a girlfriend when we met. I decided to dump her to be with this girl. I never shoot my shot because I was too scared to do so and, well, we never became anything more than good friends. 5 months ago she started dating someone. Every other night I've been crying myself to sleep since then. I never stop thinking about her and I tried my best so we wouldn't drift off and stay as friends. Nothing I did worked, and we ended up hardly ever talking, only when she felt like shit. I tried to kill myself again month ago and she called me up. I told her how I felt and she pretty much told me to stop being a dumbass. Today I told her that it would be better if we never talked again, and even after being taken off my meds by my psychiatrist and not needing therapy anymore due to being well, I have not felt this shit in months, yet I know this is better for me

It definitely reminds me of my childhood where I had very limited friends since I was sort of this emo nerd who got along with everyone but was never really kept around, no matter how hard I tried. I've had contact with a few of my close friends, but I've been wanting more than the sporadic texts or the very rare phone call. I've been sort of falling into the routine of getting up, writing or drawing, cleaning, reading, studying just for the hell of it, and exercising. My dogs passed away last year, and they were the only reasons why I felt anything and the only reasons why I stayed home after college.

I can't ask my family for support since they keep telling me ""millions of people are going through the same thing"". But are those millions of people suffering related to them? No. I get it, people have it worse, but I'm allowed to feel the way I feel. I had a lot of time to research my own psyche and why I am the way I am, and it sucks really bad. I miss working so I can distract myself from those thoughts, and the thoughts of returning home feeling like I'm not good enough. Feeling like I'm a failure for being 25 and not being financially stable enough to make rent in Hawaii, where it costs a fucking kidney and liver to rent a shitty ass apartment and have a car, even with another person. I help out as much as I can at home, but it never feels like enough. I thought I was going somewhere with my life. I had huge plans.

This is the first time in a very long time I've let my feelings out since I always felt like I was being a baby when I did. As long as I can remember, I've kept my feelings to myself because when I was a kid it was always ""Don't get upset."", ""Why are you getting mad for?"", ""There's no reason to be depressed, it's all in your head."", ""You can't hang out with these decent kids you like because I don't know or like them."" So as a result, instead of being resilient like I thought I was throughout high school and college, it turns out I've just become an overly-critical, avoidant, closed-off asshole who kept her nose in books instead of trying to make meaningful relationships. I'm still trying to work out how to maintain friendships, maintain a relationship, and not distance myself the moment I get too close to anyone. I think I might be so closed off that even words can't help me at this point. Yet, I still miss people.

I didn't even ask to be born, as ungrateful as it sounds. I thought I was getting better, too. It might have just been my imagination.",Depression

My family is not poor but we're not doing that great either. But due to being in med school I'm being exposed to a lot of flexing (both intended and unintended) from my classmates. This is mostly because a lot of the students here have medic parents, and are therefore pretty rich. Cool cars, newest phone, expensive PCs, expensive clothes.

Now I don't really care about phones and clothes, but seeing them drive cool cars and play the newest games hurts me deeply, as both of those are big passions of mine. I love cars but my parents can't afford to buy me one, and med school doesn't leave me time to get a job. I also love gaming but all I have is a crappy laptop and I can't afford a better one right now either.

Due to all of this, it pains me when we leave class and almost every friend of mine hops into their car while I walk home or they give me a lift. Same when my friends talk about such and such video game while I sit there thinking what 2002 game I should play.

Now, I know what you're (probably) going to say: Some people have it worse. And I agree. But here's the kicker. A lot of people also have it a lot better. Some dudes my age drive million dollar cars and have the most expensive shit, and I can't help but hate this life for being so unfair and wondering why I wasn't born rich too. And nobody seems to ever think about how quite a lot of people have it so much better, instead focusing on the people that have it worse. And that whole ""Money does not buy happiness"" is just a tactic for rich people to keep us simpletons from rioting against their evil thiefy asses and settle for the leftovers.

This also brings me to another issue: I hate rich people with all my broke-ass heart. I have rich friends and they are nice, but it seems like most rich people are complete assholes. And it irks me how some dudes flex their wealth even though their parents are rich, not themselves. But still, their life is a lot easier and more fun. And I hate them because of my envy. This poisons my soul and makes me a bitter person.

Again, I would love to work and buy the stuff I want, but I really don't have time for a job. Med shool is quite hard, and not even the quarantine makes it any better since I still wake up early, still study, still partake in classes and lectures (online) and still have assignments. I don't know what job I could possibly sneak into my schedule since I have like 2 free hours daily. And this is not bullshit, I'm down to try anything if you have suggestions.

Every day, from when I wake up until I go to sleep, I hate my life for being so mediocre and unfair. Please help me stop being so materialistic. I'm sure there are lots of wise people here that could guide me and save my soul. This thing is ruining me, it's really bad. It clouds my judgement and makes me hateful. But no matter how hard I try, I always come back to my mindset of ""Why should I bother working my ass off just to MAYBE have a fraction of what other people lucked into at birth? Why play the rigged game? Life is unfair and I shouldn't bother since I was unlucky at birth""

Please help me get rid of this mentality. I know I'm a hateful piece of shit that doesn't appreciate what he has, but I want to change this.",Depression

Since January I’ve been at the lowest point(s) of my life.

Things got marginally better and I didn’t have the inclination to go through it on march 15th, but two weeks prior to that date I slipped mentally and tried to sufficate myself in my bathroom. I think I knew it wouldn’t work but I was hoping it would. To me that was **ROCK BOTTOM** and I’ve been doing so poorly since then. Between then and the date I orginally chose to kill myself, I picked up vaping nicotine to deal with the feeling of unworthiness. The date approaching was traumatic and so was already having attempted to kill myself. Shortly after, and having quit vaping, I was forced to move back home from college.

I was having a pretty bad episode after not having one for years when I went to the doctor to get some blood work for an unrelated reason. It turns out that I was severely difficient in vitamin D. I was perscribed pills, and they have had the biggest impact on my depression that any medication has ever had. It's like night and day. I'm currently going through a breakup that came out of nowhere and I'm actually doing ok. If you live in an area with overcast weather or rarely leave the house and don't get sun, I would ask your doctor about it, or if you can't do that just try some over the counter stuff.

All my friends are over the internet. No one makes plans with me, no one stops by to see me, no one cares. Even if they did my life still sucks.

but now i fucking swear my depression is totally in charge of me and i can’t regain that control. it doesn’t just make me cry and mope, it completely changed the way i think. i lost my level-headedness that i was always so proud of. my depression keeps me up until 5 am and wakes me up at 8. i’m so tired that i have to drink tons of coffee but i can’t eat a bite of anything without feeling immediately nauseated. so all that’s in my system is caffeine, all day, every day. always jittery and anxious and in cold sweats. i feel like i’m some form of walking depression.

i never thought i’d understand how some people could be moved to suicide. i know i have things and people to live for. i know i have people who love me and who’d be devastated if i really did it. i always felt a little anger for people who so readily expressed their desire to die because i know it costs so much for the loved ones of suicide victims. 

but like i said, depression controls you. it makes me think differently about suicide. yes, i would devastate my loved ones by killing myself. but, as insensitive as this sounds, i wouldn’t feel the guilt of hurting them. i’d be dead. besides, they’d overcome it. they would mourn me, miss me, some longer than others, but it wouldn’t kill them. they would learn to be strong and they would finally take me seriously enough learn from my mistakes. i know i have a lot of life ahead of me right now. but do i? “it gets better.” says who? who’s to say it doesn’t get worse? every time i’ve been in a low place, it gets “better” just long enough that i let my guard down. then it gets bad again, seemingly worse each time. i reassure myself sometimes by picturing myself happy, with a family and tons of kids. that’s my dream. but why should i believe that will happen? i can’t make someone fall in love with me. not everyone finds love, and that’s just a fact.

it just seems it’s very possible that i’m suffering like hell right now because i’m holding onto hope that it will get better, when i could just stop.",Depression

They constantly remind me of my shortcomings and pick on me and he just begs me to ride it out until we can move our new trailer off their land so I don't have to deal with it anymore. Some days I feel like I can do it. But today.... fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This was a bad day.

I got randomly grabbed out of nowhere on the neck, picked on a little in a fun joking manner but my anxiety took it and ran, and I realized nobody needs me anymore. Nobody. At my home I had 12 pets. 4 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos. I lost 2 of the dogs and 3 of the cats. My leopard geckos are being housed with a friend but they can't take care of them much longer. My remaining dogs and cats, including my service dog, are with a foster mom. Since Coronavirus I lost my job and their trip (that I'm paying for) to me is postponed indefinitely. They've all accepted her as their mom.

My pitbull hated her new collar that I sent her at first because that was the collar she knew with me. But she also had it during 2 trips to the pound (when I adopted her she had it and when my mom dropped her at the pound she kept it before I had a friend readopt her for me as I was already across the country. I paid for it.) Today foster mom tells me she loves the new collar now. The old collar got brought out and she ran from it. She ran. She doesn't need me anymore. None of them do. My service dog accepted foster mom as new home within a week. Pitbull took 2 months but she's finally given up on me. My cats never needed me. I was a fool to think they did. I've never been without pets ever. I'm 19, we always had at least 3 in my household. They're my reason for living. I'm becoming a veterinarian to help them. I've wanted to since I was 9. But they don't need me. I'm useless. And worthless. I can't commit suicide because my instinct to survive is too strong. It's like my brain and heart want to die but my body won't give up on me. I can't bring myself to try. I can't even do that right...

 ""Why do we cut? Is it because we're depressed? It it because we try to show people that their words don't hurt as much as the blade? Or do we just want to feel something? Whatever the reason is; we (not all) feel the need to be asked.
  We don't like it when you found out that from someone else. We want to tell you what goes through our mysterious minds. Is a bit difficult when you're yelling though.. you aren't the ""police"" trying to make us tell you some type of information. If you could just CALMY ask us. Screaming will just make us want to keep all our feelings out of your sight so that you won't yell.
  We understand that you are worried or desperate to know,but we won't tell you willingly if you don't want to listen willingly. Please try understand.. we feel like no one could ever care if we die,disappear,or have problems in our lifes. You probably never went through what we went through. We can feel that you are upset or disappointed at us, but please.. don't give up on us.
  We might keep doing it until we are as empty as an egg shell. Not only do we cut,but we try to get rid of pain in many ways. Some do drugs,vape,drink,or are just darn mean. Some cut,bite,try to suffocate, drown,hang,or cry. We are people; and just like animals:not all of us are bad.
  When I get upset at someone,I do many different things. I get out of there,I break something,bite, or just cry for how much I feel like hurting them. While am typing this.. I cutted my arm.. a little too dip than usual. My arm feels tingly, numb,and I feel an urge to taste my blood. Wierd?
  When people make me feel depressed, I have a sick pain in my stomach that makes me feel like throwing up or punching my stomach. I just read that when you cut yourself; your life spam(or something like that) decreases by 6%. I must be close to dying then :')... I have many friends that do the same,that feel like they can't keep on going. Some friends that I left behind because of moving. 
  She had depression.. I don't know how she's doing now. I hope she made it to the top! After talking to one of my old friends, she said that four people had died during Freshman year. I was so worried that it could have been my friend.. I left her without succeeding to make her change her mind.
  I have more in my mind,but am too tired. I'll go to sleep now. Night. And morning just in case I don't wake up..""",Depression
"I’ve never been suicidal, and I’ve always assumed I’d never be put on anti-depressants unless I was suicidal. But I’m starting to think otherwise. Anyone have any POSITIVE experiences with SSRIs?",2,g1lbf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1lbf6/ive_never_been_suicidal_and_ive_always_assumed_id/,1,1586955314.0,"I think like many people on here, I’ve been plagued by depression most of my life. At least as far back as I can remember, likely the early teenage years (I’m 25 now). With being indoors all day, it only has gotten worse. 

My depression has never made me think about suicide, not even for a fraction of a second. I just never have thought about it.

My depression is simply lack of literally all energy. I wake up, and lay in bed for a solid 3 hours (on a good day). I think nothing happy, and just feel absolutely no happiness or urgency to do anything. 

Over the past year, since being in grad school, my depression has most definitely gotten worse. I don’t want to get up. No amount of caffeine can help me accomplish anything. I truly just do NOT have energy in me.

I have tried everything to bring positive change in my life. After the 3 hours of doing Fuck all, I drag myself to the gym 5-6 days a week. I am able to eat healthy. I’ve managed to get quite muscular, while at the same time being horribly depressed with no desire to pursue friendships or relationships. I go on long walks, I run and other forms of cardio.

There is only so much exercise and self care I can do. It keeps me from falling into a true pit of despair I believe, but it certainly doesn’t cure my depression in the slightest.

I’ve now started to think trying anti depressants may be for me. I had my testosterone tested. Twice. It’s completely normal. So I know it isn’t lack of that hormone, which I had suspected before to due lack of libido.

Does this sound like a case which would see a positive change by trying anti depressants? Can I at least try it, come off if I don’t like it? I honestly don’t know what else to do at this point. I’m not in danger of trying to take my own life. I just simply don’t have energy to DO any life.",Depression

  We were outside, sitting around a small table in our front of the house. Just enjoying the day with some coffee and tea(me lol). I already had made up my mind to tell her about it. I was shaking. I wrote down what I felt that day(July 4, 2019). This is what I wrote:
 
"" I told my grandma that I liked girls. And now I can't stop crying for what she told me.. I have a major headache for holding back my screams.. or probably because I started hitting my head on the floor.
I feel like leaving because there is just no way of undoing this. Why did I say that? I was having a lovely morning and I opened my big stupid mouth! I don't feel like getting out of my room for anything.. I haven't had breakfast either.. shit. 
I just have got to calm down.. but I can't! When I think I finally stopped crying, I think of what happened and more tears keep reappearing.. kill me please.""
  
  I told her that she'd be disappointed and would throw me out. She was disappointed and said that she wouldn't throw me out.

When I was in high school and when my dad was able to drop me off at school, we never spoke to each other. Nothing was said from the time that I woke up to getting into his car to leaving. The most that he would say was “I’ll be in the car!” He was always on and off unemployment which sucked because my mom was in school and working a full time job. My dad would just complain that they were spending too much money on my education and kept asking me if I wanted to go to the local public school, not understanding the value of a private school education.  Though they all took turns parenting me, I was always distant with all of these family members. I remember coming home everyday, depressed just lying on the couch putting on the news everyday, just in my own little world. My grandma would come over to just do the dishes and leave. My mom wasn’t going to do the dishes after working day and night everyday and my dad didn’t want to do them. Whenever I tried talking to my mom she would ignore me, always stressed from having the workload and responsibility that she had. When she is stressed she shuts down. After awhile I gave up on my relationship with my mom. If she doesn’t want to talk to me she dosent have to to. But that’s the last person in people’s lives that they would expect to not regularly engage with them. I felt so alone, abandoned. I was late to school everyday, ate the same food and sat at a lunch table that I knew wouldn’t judge me. I wouldn’t always talk. 

I just don’t understand why my parents weren’t always there for me. They have since apologized but it’s too late. They want me off of my meds but I just want to scream at them and tell them that you did this! I don’t want to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It was your genes that I inherited and there were certain events that happened where you could have been there for me but since I had no one, I blamed myself for everything.  I had no one to combat those suicidal thoughts.  Where were my parents when I needed them? This could have been addressed so long ago but it’s now that you are concerned about my mental health? I’m depressed now and they have no idea. They were the most controlling parents growing up and I feel like my freedom would be threatened if I talked to them. Saying that it’s in the past dosent change anything. I feel too proud to ask them for any help. I hired my psychiatrist and therapist for that. I wouldn’t want them to help me. I would never see my room again. They would be trying to talk to me the entire day but I’m a very reserved person. Just seeing my dad triggers me.",Depression

"TRIGGER WARNING (sexual assault, drugs, Suic*de, S*lf h*rm, Eating disorders) it's really long sorry lol",1,g1kcmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1kcmt/trigger_warning_sexual_assault_drugs_suicde_slf/,1,1586951009.0,"recently I've been having a lot of issues with some less than fun memories.

**Sexual assault below** 

I was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade I was 11, maybe 12 at the time, it was in public by a peer and I knew other people who watched it happen but no one did or said anything so I did the same and at the time I never felt like it hadn't hurt me or anything, I didn't see my body any differently I didn't blame myself, nothing, I just passed it off and moved on with my life and that was fine...

**Drugs below**

But eventually I kinda thought about it and it all came crashing down, the realization of how much it actually did hurt me but I pushed it all deep down as a reflex and had no clue I was even doing it, as first I tried to get my mind off it with drugs, mainly weed, and at the lowest point when I was going to give up on myself, LSD, now for the average, healthy, responsible adult both drugs wont cause any physical damage as long as it was done in a safe place but both drugs were done when I was between 12 and 13 and only 2 or 3 I did drugs was I in a safe place and luckily the time I did LSD I was at least unable to hurt myself and didn't want to hurt others but I was at school.

**suic\*de below**

The day I did LSD I planed to go home that night and commit suic\*de but when I arrived at school a friend asked if I wanted to do LSD I said yes because I figured ""what do I have to lose?"" I was coming down from my high as I went home and by the time I arrived I was exhausted and ended up sleeping all day and into the next morning and had missed my only chance for months to come.

 **s\*lf h\*arm below**

So I moved onto the next coping mechanism I could think of which was self harm but after almost being caught time and time again, constantly needing to clean blood covered things, and my familys growing suspicion I had to give that up too which I wish I could say was for the best.

**eating disorder below**

The last thing I tried before I shoved the memory into the deepest part of my mind was to get a grip, have control over the one thing I could, what I ate, I knew right away that I wanted to starve myself unlike most stories of anorexia it didn't start as a diet, it started as eating as little as I could physically get away with, I managed to get down to 89 pounds before I passed out after not eating or 4 days whilst still burning over 2,000 calories a day with my active life style, sadly no one noticed do to the fact that I had told the only person that was home I was going to take a shower moments before passing out on my bed room floor luckily I wasn't out for very long and I was so scared by it that I ate right away and have been trying to get better for years but I keep relapsing.

I bring this up because the memory has resurfaced and I don't know what to do with it",Depression

I'm trying to figure a way to give my life a meaning, because I'm currently stuck with ""if I did that, then it means that I'd lie to myself. I'd be living a lie that I, myself created. For the purpose of not feeling depressed anymore, wouldn't I fall back to the hole I dug myself in when the time comes?""
So for the time being, life doesn't have meaning.

I've always hated feeling emotions, some 20 odd years later and I'm still ""discovering"" new ones that I've seemed to ignore and suppress.
Still wondering if there is a way to shut them down, see if that's better. Managed a few times, but it's not consistent and not long enough for me to wonder if I could be like that for the rest of my life. 
To be frank I sometimes scare myself, I sometimes need to calm myself down.

Still trying to figure if I should tap in on my emotions and actually try to connect with a friend or a family member. I've always thought that to have a connection, you'd relate to one another, two distinguished lives having the same thoughts and feelings about the topics one would talk about, not completely identical, but enough to make you feel related as if you felt a connection right then and there.

And bunch of other things.. I feel that this is long enough.

And for the grand finale, life and death.
I've always perceived living as weird.
I still think about us being a side effect of whatever the hell this reality is supposed to be. And worse, if it had purpose. Why would that be? How would it work out? Who or what would be our purpose to fulfill?

I did acid about 7 months ago with someone I'm no longer friends with because everyone around me was telling me that she was toxic for me. I eventually see a therapist because my friends recommended I do as I tended to lash out at them. The therapist tells me that I have PTSD. I've lost all of my friends because I think that they're all less mature than me and that I've outgrown all of them. The only reason I stick around is because I'll be alone and I'll blame myself. I see the world so differently, I know acid and my (current) weed usage that my mother is actually okay with. She allows me to smoke weed because she thinks it's helping with my anxiety. I try to convince myself it doesn't but deep down I know it is. I tried hydrocodone after fucking stealing from my grandpa's cabinet. I don't know if I'm a teenager acting out, or if something is seriously wrong with me. I'm failing school, literally. All F's and I have had all F's since 6th grade. Yet for some reason they never decided to hold me back. I wish they did, cause now I'm the really dumb freshman who's always missing school and smokes weed. I don't want to be known as that. My therapist tells me that I'm actually quite intelligent for my age. This quarantine has really been messing me up even more. I came in contact with weed again, I can't talk to my therapist anymore because of it, I'm eating more food, I lost my routine and stay up all hours of the night, and worst of all is that I haven't done a sliver of my home school work. I know I'm fucking up, everyone I ask this to tells me that I'll be okay and that I shouldn't worry. But I know they're lying, I wish I wasn't treated like such a fucking child. My dad has sending me voicemails saying that he's out of jail and talking to me like I'm still 10 years old. I don't know how to respond to him because I don't know him at all, all he used to do with me as a kid was do everything for me. But not actually letting me figure anything out on my own, same with my mom. Speaking of my mom, since I'm the only one living with her in a 2 bedroom apartment I realized that I've been through torture for so long. The name calling she does, I get called dumb, stupid, and a pig for no reason, she makes all of these mean noises when I even try to talk to her. My therapist tells me it's her way of coping with her own insecurities because she used to be overweight and some people do say she is a bit of an airhead. Lastly, I think I've realized that I have so much more stuff to go through. I thought I had the answer to everything, I thought I was psychic. I still sometimes think I am. And after looking at all of this your only question is probably ""how have you not killed yourself yet?"" and I don't know. I don't want to kill myself, I just wouldn't care if I died because I provide nothing either way.

Any advice helps,1,g1jzfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1jzfy/any_advice_helps/,2,1586949445.0,"Hi,

My name is Jarred and over the last year in my life I have had an ongoing issue of anxiety and depression. I began therapy for anxiety in October of this year which lead to a big drop in my overall anxiety, but I never really brought up depression, as I thought these feelings had direct correlation to my anxiety. However, as therapy went on I soon realized that my depression was an independent issue. But I decided not to bring it up as my mom, who put me into therapy (I was 17 at the time), and my therapist both believed my life was changing for the better and I was a much happier person. The whole goal of therapy was to get my anxiety ready for me to move out and go to college come August and in the eyes of my therapist and mother, I have reached that point.

Fast forward to today. I recently started dating a girl I met at work and our relationship has surpassed any expectations I had for it. I am very happy to say I love my girlfriend and she makes me very happy. However, my depression really drags me down at times and I have constant feelings that I am worthless and I will often feel insecure about myself. I have very few friends and at times I feel like I have nobody in my life. The only person I have to turn to when I am feeling this way is my girlfriend. While she makes me feel much better about myself and cares a ton about my mental health, I feel like I vent to her too much and if I countinue like this she will end up leaving me. So I resort to crying by myself and feeling like total shit. I do not know where these feelings come from or what to do, and I feel just as lonely as I did before I had my girlfriend sometimes. Please give me any advice you feel could help my situation. Thanks.",Depression

Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,1770,g1jxci,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1jxci/perhaps_whats_worse_than_depression_is_not_being/,70,1586949193.0,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

In law school. Life sucks. Quality of life is on the decline. Compared to past generationts we are producing more and more wealth for our corporate overlords while quality of life continues to fall. Bad enough. Due to COVID, I am now unemployed this summer and had to move back in with my parents. Hate it. Compeltely feels like everything I ever worked for is pointless. That I am back at square one.

Live in Canada but of South Asian Muslim background. South Asian Muslim culture is f*cked up. Teens and young adults are infantilized. Really not good for one's self-esteem and sense of self worth. I was a devout Muslim in my teens. Left the faith about 4 years ago. I believe in creator and I do believe in certain religious values but I do not believe in Islam or in any particular religion. Honestly, I abhor Islam. The God of Islam is harsh and cruel and has ridiculous demands. Full rigidity. No Flexibility. Like starting in 10 days I have to spend a month starving and dehydrating myself to appease a psychotic God who will severely punish me if I don't. It spikes my depression. And since I am unemployed at stuck at home, I really have to sneak to cheat. And I feel bad doing it when my family is fasting. My dad is really religious and I have a super religious grandma (typical stereotype) so religion is a dominant topic in the house. I also have objections to its truth claims, I just in good conscience cannot accept Muhammed as an infallible final prophet and a source of moral authority

I have never really had it great. Never really had friends growing up outside of a couple family friends. Didn't really make friends till undergrad, and the first group of friends I made turned out to be sociopaths out to get me. I have some friends now. I am also close to my little cousins but they live abroad so I cannot really be in contact with them. Of course, my extended family are all mostly practicing Muslims as well so I cannot really have an honest relationship w/ them and I worry about the future. Either I have to pretend to be a Muslim, end up in a loveless arranged marriage, and keep familial ties. Or I officially leave the faith and destroy my family.

In my 4th year of undergrad (2017-2018) I fell in love with someone who was everything I ever wanted in a partner. Successful, moral, life-partner type, virign, great with kids (all of which I bring to the table). Everything I was looking for. She also was, as a bonus, from a well-of finally and beautiful. She was what it seemed to be a true happily ever after. I had suffered a lot and worked hard in life. My family isn't poor (though we were that when we were younger) but we are not rich. My undergrad college though was full of rich, white private school kids. I put in a lot of effort to get where I am at (my resume is stellar and I had to overcome a lot of barriers to get there). The idea that my effort paid of and I could marry a rich white private school girl was a dream come true. She and I got along very well. She was kind hearted. I really thought I had found my match. But for whatever reason, she rejected me. My entirety of everything I worked so hard toward my whole life for - my happily ever after (and yes I know no marriage is truly like that) taken away from me.
I have not been able to find anyone like her. And even worse, because I am male, I have been attacked instead of given sympathy. The dating system is rigged against men. Men are systematically oppressed by women into making the first move. Into taking the emotional burden. Into being and acting a certain way and catering to women's views. Women claim to believe in equality but sure don't act it, by holding men to traditional gender roles while they themselves have been freed from it. Men are still statistically seen as ATMs and providers. And this has bene shown from what people have told me. People have attacked me for wanting a fair deal. That because I am a man I have to be open to marrying down. That despite all the barriers I overcame, I have to be open to marrying someone who has it easier and didn't accomplish as much, ruining all the effort I made in life. That because of my gender, it is my fault she rejected me because I didn't ""ask her out correctly"" or whatever BS hoops men are expected to jump through. (I don't see how it should make a difference but apparently it does. Must be nice being a privelged woman). As a man, I am told that I must just accept a woman who slept around and then wants to settle later in life. Doesn't matter that I come in with purity and certain values. That I have to accept nonense. She didn't go down 2 steps to be with me, and her things were based on privilege of birth, not effort or morals. But I am expected to go down 20 steps to be with whomever

She also was a Catholic. So when I fell for her I started looking into the faith and I found a different kind of God. A loving God. I was so close to converting. If I actually married her, I would have converted. But I do not think the faith is true either. Sure I like things about it, but if it were true God would have given me way in, I.e. that woman's love. Again I thought I found happiness but it was taken away from me. 

I just want someone who loves me unconditionally for whom I am. My parents don't due to faith. So unlike most of the world, I don't have that. I don't have true love. Which is why I can never be happy. And it seems that men do not get true love. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. That men do get valued beyond being resources for women, but it doesn't seem like that.

I would love to be a rich western culture woman. Get the best of everything. I encountered many of them at undergrad, living the dream life. It would be great to have parents accept you for who you are. It would be great to have financial oppurnity. To have tons of self-esteem boosts from suitors. To have true love and relationship dynamics rigged in your favour. I love kids, if I was a woman I could get either get a one night stand (though that kind of behavior is not my thing) or go to a sperm bank and get a kid. As a man, I must commit to a woman and hope she doesn't divorce and take the kids. More stress, less options

I really hate who I am. I wish I were a rich western woman. Living that happy life. Instead I am cursed. Never fully accepted by my family. Raised in a f*cked up religion / culture. Oppressed via society due to my gender. Never get true love and be loved unconditionally for who I am. Quite likely never get kids. Never get happiness. And will just suffer, working as a corporate slave till I die.

>""every experience strengthens you""

>""it gets better eventually""
>
>""this medicine will help""

>""You're valuable""

To say I've had a ""bad"" experience with the Mental Health industry is disingenuous. All my former counselors are good people. but interacting with them doesn't go anywhere. My past has *not* strengthened me. It has *not* gotten better. The medicine did *not* help. I'm *not* valuable. And please, don't bother disagreeing with that last one in the comments. That'll save us both some energy and time. That's not the point of the post, I've spent far too much energy and time discussing that with the  Mental Health industry. Thanks.

I've long held the position that if I ever end up in the hospital again, I'd never leave. because there's no growth, no plan for my future or any future. no hope for me. This is where I am, and I can't get better or worse, I can only *appear* differently, and only in the short term. Even that I think is lost for me because I can't pretend anymore. I can't pretend that this isn't how things are, and can't pretend that this isn't how things will be.

So why am I here? because in all that I have experienced, no one has agreed with me, ever. no one has actually considered or entertained my position. no one has said *""you're right, 14ierophant: that life sucks, that you're going to die, and that everything would be better if it happened soon. ****In the meantime, here's what you can do****.""*

I’ve realised that I’m not fully comfortable with anyone. Not my friends, not my boyfriend, not even my family. I always feel the need to deliver. I have to provide something otherwise they’ll get tired of me. It’s just easier by myself. When there’s no pressure to be interesting or engaging.

I remember growing up, I’d constantly change myself to suit who I was with. I’d change my personality for the sake of getting along with someone. Now, I feel like I don’t really have a personality. I bore myself with things I say and I find myself annoying. I’m not funny at all and I’m not intelligent or knowledgable and I have nothing witty or wise to say.

For these reasons I don’t really talk. I struggle with one-on-one conversations with another person. So, I can forget about group conversations or mealtime chit chat. I just don’t have anything to add. I can’t even bring myself to answer the door or pick up the phone.

Recently I’ve noticed that I’m distancing myself a lot. I don’t reach out to my friends. The conversations I have with my boyfriend these days are very repetitive and I’m worried that he’ll get bored of me and realise that I’m not as interesting as he thought. Because when he sees past his rose coloured glasses and notices that I’m not as exciting as he thought, he’ll leave. He’s the most meaningful person in my life.

I’ve never been super close to my parents. My mum even confronted me recently about how “I don’t even want to be her friend”. I feel terrible and she seemed hurt but honestly, I don’t think I can ever fully open up to someone. Not even my mum. I don’t think she’d wouldn’t like me. We are very different.

Im scared that when I transition to a new school in September, I’ll be too guarded to even try and interact with people. Then I’ll get left behind and have to spend the next two years without anyone.

I don’t know. I reading this and I feel like I’m probably making a mountain of a molehill. Oh well, at least I got it out.",Depression
"Am I really depressed, or am I just pretending I am? [16M]",1,g1j94e,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1j94e/am_i_really_depressed_or_am_i_just_pretending_i/,1,1586946425.0,"Note: Coming back after writing this, I realize I kinda get all over the place for me. I'd appreciate if you stick with me and keep reading through. Thanks.

Hey, I don't really know how to start this, but I feel like I might be depressed, but I don't know if it's just a ""Boo-hoo, I have a small problem in my life and I'm now depressed,"" which I really hate and do not want to be (I remember doing something like this where I was making jokes about depression and saying I had it - this felt this was definitely faked looking back, and I feel like a complete asshole for doing that, especially to a person who actually has depression (it almost felt like I was making fun of depression) - this is something I will hate myself forever for doing and wish I could take back so bad - I really do not want to relapse onto this behavior - I might have been doing this for the attention, but I really was not sure why I did this at the time). Basically, I \*really\* don't want to be a dick, and part of me keeps telling myself I am really just faking all of this.

I've been questioning myself about this often now, I tried denying it to myself, but I don't know.

Recently I feel like I just stopped caring for some things, especially school-work. I know I used to get anxious if I didn't turn stuff in the day it was due, or that I need to study for a particular assessment, but recently, I had that feeling disappear. I keep pushing deadlines, and I have tonnes of stuff to make up, but I haven't felt the same tension to work that I used to (this is something my mom pointed out) - making me feel lazier. I often now go into class without finishing assignments, pushing them back forever. And also, I feel a severe lack of motivation to do this work - I'm always procrastinating by watching YouTube or whatever. This made my grade drop by a lot - I usually get pretty good grades (A-B), but my last semester has been complete shit (A-C - and low C because I have not turned things in). This is making me worry I could lose my honors classes, which I really do not want to lose and is something I am stressed out about. These grades are not me, and my parents are saying I should drop these classes (which I really don't want to). I feel like it's easy and I can do it, but my grade does not paint the same picture. I want to be able to do my work, and get my grade up, but I just can't motivate myself anymore - or something is going on but I'm not sure. Yet, I am also scared as hell about losing my classes. I just don't get it.

This lack of working has given extreme frustration from my parents. It feels like everyday I'm getting yelled at for not doing my work, or at least doing enough. And when I do some of it, I have so much to catch up on, so ultimately it feels like I barely did anything, and I feel like my parents think the same, even though I sometimes spend hours catching up (also counting for when I distract myself on whatever), I get nothing - no break - no time to relax - and have to use means that I am not allowed to do to get something (like procrastinating even more or staying up late). My mom brought up concerns about a possible attention disorder, but I pushed it aside. After all, I don't want to be the kid with an attention disorder, now do I? It feels like an endless cycle I can't break.

My grades and all that jazz has lead me to lose a lot of my electronics as well. The thing is, I always feel like I really want to do something, like maybe play a game, make a video, anything inspiring, and I just can't because I'm fucking grounded. I want to go and play something on my console, because I feel like I can be happy doing that (and is something I really enjoyed), but I can't because I had that taken for saying some nasty stuff (I will touch up on this later). I also had (right now) my phone taken for, literally no reason. I know this sounds really cliche and stupid, but I feel like the things that make me happy or bring me joy are all gone. Maybe I'm being a whiny teenager who just is not thankful enough...

I also found myself getting a lot more aggressive and angry. My dad has always been a bit shouty and aggressive. He can never command me to do something while also being nice - he always rudely tells me to do whatever. I have lately been whispering stuff back (i.e: Fuck you, What an asshole, etc.) I have not always been this aggressive, but I feel myself going there. And going purely based on emotion, I fucking hate him - he can't ever leave me alone and give me privacy, and he is such an asshole by taking shit whenever he feels like it with no justification needed. He is always asking about my homework, and making it seem like I put less effort than what I really did. He keeps bringing up my work, always telling me off about it, and it's not doing me any good, and I am getting to a point where I can't fucking stand it. (Sorry, I needed that rant - I don't know if I really meant any of it - maybe I am just a normal teen going through teen stuff). I also see myself seething at trivial things, for example, right now when people are coming in my room while writing this, or when my room door was forced wide open by my parents to check in my work while writing this (probably because I want to keep this secret from them - I'll dive into this later). I don't know why I'm doing this, and it's all probably going worse with the quarantine.

I've seen myself going to the bathroom to just sit there in silence and sadness and just feeling horrible in general (usually after my dad has decided to yell at me or whatever), and bleary eyed, have to forcibly tell myself over and over again, ""I'm okay."" before I can come back out. This has been happening quite a lot.

Recently, I had an event of me just crying for no explainable reason. I went into my room and started crying. I tried to deny this. When my dad came in and asked what was wrong, he came in angry and shouting about it, and when I couldn't tell him, he got more and more furious (it almost felt like he was forced to come in - not doing this because he genuinely wanted to). My dad left out of anger and frustration, to where my mom came in and, well, just handled it a lot better. This happened once. Later in the day, my mom asked if I was depressed, to where I didn't know what to answer with, so I just said no (while kinda laughing it off).

I also caught myself eating more. Like, going into the kitchen to grab a snack for no reason. I'm not even hungry - and (context - am already a bit chubby) feel really unhealthy and bad about it. I don't know why I do this.

All these issues have all been highlighted and intensified by the quarantine we are having - especially not being able to go out (as it feels like going to school really helped me with this stuff - it was a place to get away from my parents).

\*These next two things are something I am going to find really difficult talking about (I really tried to avoid talking about these things), and frankly, I am not comfortable having online, but screw it, here it goes.\*

I have recently been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have been visualizing myself dead. Of course, I don't really want to die, but I have been thinking about it a lot - probably too much. I've also done self harm before and recently (cutting my leg), but that was either for me lashing out onto myself, or attention, or maybe both. I don't know. When my parents found out, I wanted comfort, but instead I got a yelling. I also had an incident where I was close to suicide (the issue was frankly, really dumb and it was probably more for attention than anything else), but I knew I didn't really want to die.

I also have an avid masturbation/porn addiction. It's really not doing my any well. My parents found out about this, and they (currently) are not that suspicious of it, but truly, I still have been doing it. I really hate this part of me, and want to change, but I keep relapsing. I know it's wrong (that's what religion says (plus that lives will be terrible with people who follow this path - which I am worried now that is applied to me)). I hope this isn't what brings me to hell (which speaking of, I also lately haven't been praying all that much, so that may also be a cause).

This has all taken me forever to write, and now that I just finished pouring my heart out, I should probably say I haven't told anyone all of this. Anyone. I'm scared of having depression (I don't want to have it - it would suck to be known as the one depressed kid), I don't want to go through therapy, and I don't fancy telling very many people this. I want to be normal.

I think I got everything, but I may come back to this if I feel like I missed talking about something. If you actually bothered reading through this mess, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just felt like I needed to let this all out - everything that has been bothering me - and I really appreciate you reading this. <3

However, yesterday I also weighed myself. I was kind of curious as to what my weight was, because honestly I felt like I had gained weight more than anything with all the junk I had been eating the rare times I did eat. I had lost weight, and I weighed myself again today after not eating anything and I weighed 2 pounds less than yesterday (I know it's not actual weight, just not having any water in my body). I only weigh myself when I want to lose weight (which, considering I'm already underweight isn't a very good thing). It starts small, unconsciously weighing myself and then next thing you know I'm googling the quickest way to lose weight or browsing on pro-ana Tumblr pages.

&#x200B;

It is currently 9:30 PM, my mom called me into her room to ask whether I was going to make me something to eat. I have not eaten all day, so you would think she'd be happy with me eating something... A week ago I recall her saying ""Well, at least you're eating"" when I told her about the sliders I made. I was NOT making something to eat, all I did was take some fries (LITERALLY only 5 of them) made earlier today by someone in the house out of the fridge. I didn't even bother to heat up the fries because she'd hear the microwave and get pissed off. Whenever I eat at night (for me, 8-10 is a normal time for me to eat), she tells me I'm going to get ""big and fat"" for eating at night. She thinks anything after 5 is too late to eat. I know I'm not going to, and I know Im not fat, but her words are like a little fucking depression cloud where you know it's not true but for some reason you still feel bad. I had eaten one fry before she had talked to me. After she talked to me, I went back into my room, was about to eat another fry, and then stopped myself and just cried. I don't even know why. I just cried.

&#x200B;

She's been doing this since I was a child and I'm so fucking sick of it. I remember being 7 and waking up to make a PB&J sandwich (I've been underweight and struggling to eat my whole life)... It was maybe 11 PM, and she told me I'd get fat for eating at night. It was a PB&J sandwich and I was 7, who says that to a kid? Do you know how much I weighed when I was 7? Less than 40 pounds. A normal 5 year old weighs 40 pounds and I didn't even hit 40 until I was 10 and well into my first year of puberty. I'm so tired of her projecting her insecurities on me. She's overweight, not me. She'd rather have me go a day without eating than to eat at 9 PM and that's fucking insane.

&#x200B;

I want to get up and go eat, just to spite her. But I feel too bad and insecure to do so. I want to eat the 4 fries still sitting next to me, but I cry any time I even think about it. I had a little impulse to go download Tumblr again and browse the pro-ana shit a few minutes ago. Usually I don't think about what or if I'm going to eat the next day or not, I don't plan it. But I genuinely don't even know if I'm going to want to eat tomorrow either. Part of me wants to start intentionally not eating again. I know it's bad, but I just can't get the thoughts out of my head.",Depression

Not even childhood. When I was a kid, I used to scratch my face until it bled because I thought that my freckles were ugly and the reason I had so few friends, and maybe if I scratched hard enough they would disappear. By first grade, I was in and out of therapist and psychiatrist offices. When they asked me what was wrong, I would usually say something to the effect of ""I'm the worst person ever and I don't deserve happiness"". I was once even suspended from elementary school cuz I got in trouble with the teacher for throwing a pencil at a student during a test (on a side note, the teacher yelled at me cuz I ""could've poked his eye out"", which is real fucking stupid since there were folders up so I literally just hit his folder and not him; I think the teacher just hated me), and on the walk down to the principal's office, I banged my chest until my the teacher constrained my arms because I wanted my heart to stop. The principal would not allow me back in school until I received a psychiatric evaluation.

I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I'll feel fine for a good while, and then it'll hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I couldn't even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I'm simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know if I'm ever going to return to college. I'm still in debt for this class too. I'm living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan.

Anyone else wish they could catch Covid-19 and die from it?,3,g1gqz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1gqz1/anyone_else_wish_they_could_catch_covid19_and_die/,0,1586936890.0,"I've  been thinking about committing suicide for a long time. The one thing  that's always stopped me from taking a kitchen knife and slicing myself  open, and watching the blood spurt out like a *Kill Bill* film, is knowing what people would think of me. My family and friends would know I couldn't hack it and was a disappointment.

But now, Covid-19 has come on the scene.

Dying  from coronavirus is a blameless death. No-one can call you a failure  for catching it, it's a virus that strikes the poor and rich, the Tom  Hanks and the Baldricks of the world alike. And compared to suicide, the  loneliest of deaths, dying from Covid-19 is a merciful, beautiful  death.

Compare with dying because I  deliberately overdosed on my antidepressants: and being found four  weeks later by the custodian crowbarring my door open because the  neighbours complained of a mysterious overpowering stench caused by my  badly decomposing corpse (the place where I lay leaving a dark stain on  the carpet that no amount of scrubbing can remove, and which the tenants  that moved in after me do their best to try to ignore).

Meanwhile,  with Covid-19, I'd be surrounded by doting doctors and nurses fussing  over me, applying balms and soothing salves to my skin. My mother and  father would Zoom in to cry over me and call me a poor thing as I drew  my last breaths on a ventilator, and ascend to heaven under the angelic,  white light of fluorescent hospital filaments.

Where  I live, New Zealand, is one of the few states not majorly affected by  coronavirus (we have 9 deaths so far). With so few deaths, each person  that passes away gets a full spread on the newspapers and wall-to-wall  coverage on the TV for a week about their life story and interviews with  their grieving relatives. My death, if it was by Covid-19, would be  remembered, and my life would have mattered. As a young lad in my 20s,  my death would be used to save lives. I'd be used by the media as a  wake-up call to young people that even they can die from this silly flu,  and that they should stay at home. Then, many years hence, I would be  remembered as one of the honored martyrs that sacrificed their lives to  Covid-19. Every year, in April, there would be a nationwide memorial  service where the names of all those that died of coronavirus would be  read out, and fresh lilies and white doves released by my gravesite.

Covid-19: could anyone wish for a more beautiful death?

I feel so emotionless that sometimes I feel like I'm going speechless; not like I don't know what to say but like literally speechless, my mind gets out of control and I feel like going completely silent. I feel so emotionless, so unconnected to my body and to my soul. When I look at this empty life I feel like I'm in nightmare, but then I pretend I'm okay so good that I can even fool myself it's okay. Nothings connected. I'm so out of touch with my memories. It's just now and random thoughts I can think of, nothing is sorted in any way. Sometimes I get better days, when I wake up in a brave mood, ready to cop with it. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up, and the cycle starts again. I don't know what to expect. It feels like some part of me gave up on me and I can't continue without it. I don't know what's real. I don't know what's faith. I don't know nothing but fear. I feel like a ghost haunted by ghosts that tease me with all of this experience, not pushing to the point where I am really delusional or hear voices or whatever's the maximum level of fucked up mentality, but they tease me just enough to become more crazy and crazy with each day. I just can't feel anything but a creepy peace. I can't remember emotions. I can't imagine a happy place. Feels like I achieved everything. Or like I've achieved nothing, nothing that truly matters. I don't know if I'm getting better. I don't know if I'm getting worse. Recently it got to that point where I absolutely lost control of my mind and where it wanders. I'm so so empty and no medication can truly help it, I believe; no therapy either - I already told the most important people in my life and it didn't give me a relief. Being honest used to be a safe spot, but I played with lies and being honest my whole life so much that I lost the difference between good and evil. I could manipulate every situation to work in my favor. Now I can't be real. But should I blame myself? My shitty childhood and early teenage life created this coping mechanism, not me. It used to be a defense from the cruel world, now I'm consumed by it. Feels like I can no longer escape. I wish I could sleep happily again...",Depression

Unable to appreciate the now, always assuming there is more to life and never able to accept things the way they are. I think back to the perfectly trimmed memories I have of days before I felt this way and I disregard any notion of nostalgia and assume that in those moments, I felt as happy as those memories seem. I am always chasing that impossible feeling of peace and satisfaction and it often comes in the form of flashbulb visions

I can be thinking about or doing whatever, and a random flash of an unknown setting will commandeer my mind for a second. There are some that reoccur and some that are fresh every time. Sometimes its just a staircase of a home that is incandescently lit, sometimes its a night at home in an apartment I've never seen. Just like a dream, there can be context for the vision. This comes in the form of details about my life at the time. It could be 20 years form now with a family that I love. Whatever it is, it's random and and torturous. Its like a fishing line with bait that is constantly held above my head, taunting me for my inability to attain satisfaction. I don't know what these are trying to tell me but they are a constant reminder that I am not satisfied with what I have. 

I often get lost in the fleeting image that has been left behind after it happens. I struggle with a near obsession with escapism in my lower moods and these visions walk hand in hand with that. I spiral into a jealousy for a dream that is impossible and with every jealous mood I grow farther from accepting reality as it is, allowing me to finally be happy or at peace.

Does anyone else feel similar or experience anything of the sort? I was just writing this to get my thoughts into words but I would appreciate some discussion. I feel very alone in this.",Depression

Just some long ass monologue,3,g1fwtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1fwtw/just_some_long_ass_monologue/,2,1586933943.0,"Im just tired.  Of every single damn thing.

Of my family, for which Im just a caretaker for my grandma and uncle (her son) for the rest of my fucking life, because nobody else cares about them, and partially I cannot blame them; grandma is not a nicest person to be around most of the time, let's put it this way, and I'm always around since i live with her.

Of my mother, who has been using me for so many years, just so everything will stay HER way. Telling me to cry when dad came home lately and ask him ""why are you not with me and mommy anymore, we're worried"", or to refuse his plushie bear he gave me on the children's day, just 'cause they were separated. Years later, when I run away from dad and went to live with grandma (that was long ago, when she wasn't that way she is now), she often told me how she always missed me and my sister, how she know that dad was manipulating me and ""forgives me"" for things I said when I WAS 7 GODDAMN YEARS OLD. how she went on rehab and was hardly drinking anymore, how she loved me and always would be here for me. And now? Anytime I went to visit her she was always drinking her ass off, making excuses as always. Wanted to intimidate me to cancel my plans to leave my city and move out to the other side of the country, saying that ""If i do it, i won't be having a mother anymore"". And honestly, yeah, she's right. I won't. I don't want a mother who cares so little about her fucking daughter that openly tells that ""she doesn't want to go with me to therapist 'cause she has better things to do and i simulate everything anyway"", and when I tried to open up to her that one goddamn time and told her about my self-harm problems and two suicide attempts, she just shrugged it off and said ""ah, okay, nice"". So, yeah. She's right. I don't have a mother anymore and I honestly don't know if I ever had one.

Of my father, who just... didn't cared then and doesn't care now. Who is able to go arm with arm with me on the street and pretend he don't see me, just to avoid conversation. Who has the balls to text me about ""how he misses us"" and ""how everyone is against him"", and then act like he doesn't know me, my sister, his siblings or his ex wife. But, well, at least he never tried to hide that he don't care.  


Of my sister, who is the only person in my whole family that I'm actually afraid my death would hurt more than a bit. She's just... too pure for her own good. When I couldn't hide that i'm crying she was trying to make a fucking ""memes"" out of random google images, just to make me laugh. And she was actually only one trying to be with me, understand, even tho she's only fucking 10 and i'm, well, a shitty person in general and a lot more shitty older sister. I don't want to push her away, so my death would be less painful for her, but I also don't want her to be hurt in any way, especially not because of me. I don't know what to do.

Of my friends, who just.. I'm too attached to to just leave them like that. I know that they don't care about me that much, that when I die all it will take for them to forget about me is just a couple weeks, but i care about them. If I'm useful to them, if I can help them with their own problems, If i can do anything to make them feel better and have better lives than they have now, I have to fucking do it. Even if that will take years, I want them to be happy. And still... I'm so tired of this perspective and my selfishness. That I can't just end it now, that I HAVE TO keep going for them, to help them overcome their own problems, that I have to keep waiting even for years to finally feel good with myself ending all of this and even though I will always be for them just a third wheel, just this weird girl who they can always talk to when their better friends aren't around.Of me, not being able to handle everything that's going on.

Of my fucking mind not being able to do things properly, care about myself, my future and self-care anymore. Of being too fucked up to even pass my last year of high school. Of not getting over an ended friendship (toxic as fuck, but still) with a girl I can't stop feel something to, even if she had made my mind even bigger mess that it was already, telling me that ""If i want to kill myself that much, then I should do it now, 'cause only thing I deserve is to die alone"", of being unable to hate her, of being too shitty to do anything productive or learn anything useful. Of being always ""not good enough"". Of waiting.

I only have a limited time to be young and honestly I can barely bear the thought of another month of this, let alone years or this becoming the new normal. I have never had this consistent thoughts of suicide even if this isn't the most depressed I've ever been. It just has never seemed this hopeless.

They keep coming to me asking for help with computers, video games, what to have for meals, how to make the meals, whether or not they should buy eggs at the store or throw away a flyer for homeowners insurance (we rent an apartment). 

How can I communicate to them that I’m not capable of all this right now? You’d think that the fact that I start crying hysterically, pulling at my hair, and screaming “I can’t do this!!!!” when they ask me for help would be a good clue. But they still don’t get it. 

I’m in serious, serious trouble. I haven’t had a depressive episode this bad in years. To top it all off, my husband lost his job and we don’t have health insurance. I’m trying to take care of myself the only way I know how, but they’re making it impossible.

Relapsed,2,g1fawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1fawl/relapsed/,7,1586931862.0,"I stated cutting again yesterday. I’d stopped for 3 months and then it just happened. It’s like an addiction- if you ever go back to it- you can’t stop again straight away. Yesterday I had 25 cuts, today I had 83. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think, but I’m too scared to admit my issues. Last time my mum saw my cuts, she told me I was stupid. Told me I wasn’t depressed while I cried and screamed. She told me I was only crying because I’d been caught. The only reason she found out is because I told my closest friend- she said I couldn’t keep doing this and told her. She thought she would help me. My mum never does. She threatens to put me in a nutty institute and when she finally promises she’ll take me to a therapist- she never does. I don’t expect her to help anymore. All she did was cause more pain, made it easier for me to self harm and allowed my mental state to deteriorate. I don’t know how much longer I can do this for.

is feeling neutral towards everything related towards depression?,2,g1fae8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1fae8/is_feeling_neutral_towards_everything_related/,2,1586931816.0,"like, i wouldn't call it numbness, it's just that i have no strong feelings, towards most things. e.g. when my therapist asked me how i found the session, i didn't know what to say because i have no feelings about it - it was just something that happened. and a lot of the time when she asks me things like ""do you want to improve on x?"" i just answer that i don't know (because there's not really anything i want). i also feel this way in most of my friendships; they're my friends and i ""love"" them, but i don't really get attached to or trust anyone. recently i've opened up a little to 2 of my friends, but it wasn't really about trusting them more, it's just i don't care if they tell people, because i'm not scared of losing friends. and i do want close relationships, it just seems like i'm unable to connect to anything. everything and everyone just exists, and that's all.

I am 20 years old.  In early childhood, I lost both parents.  The first 9 years of 11 at school I had practically no friends.  I walked alone, chatted with people from other cities on the Internet.  In the last 2 years of school I have changed.  made many friends, had fun with them.  Everything was the same in the first year and a half of the university.  Then bad things happened in my life.  I got depressed.  (I have a confirmed diagnosis).  For about a year I did not go anywhere except study and shop, rarely went for a walk.  I stopped seeing all my friends in real life.  Over the past half year I went to the party 3 times.  I forced myself to go there because I thought it would help me.  During this time, I began to feel worse every day.  It seems to me that people are looking at me because something is wrong with my face.  Every time I meet a girl I like, thoughts arise in my head that I am a jerk, and should not even think about her.  My mind makes me think that I am not worthy to be part of someone's life.  And I believe in it more and more.  I am not trying to find new hobbies for myself, because I am afraid that others will laugh at me.  But the worst thing is that for a long time, I think about suicide every day.  These thoughts arise completely suddenly.  Sometimes it’s enough for me to look at my face in the mirror, and my brain begins to think that such a freak as I am not worthy to even appear in public, and it is better for him to kill himself.  I am very much afraid, because every day these thoughts arise more often, and they are more and more detailed.  The only thing that keeps me here is my relatives.  I'm afraid to go completely crazy.  Now I am very lonely, I have not seen friends for many weeks.  All I dream about is a normal life, like everyone else.  But I feel that I will either commit suicide or die because my body weakens every day.  I don’t have money for a psychologist, and it’s unlikely that they will help me here, but at least I could speak out, and it became a little easier for me.  I have too many mental disorders, but I can’t talk about them in more detail, because the text is so very long.  Thanks if you read this.",Depression
I invested everything I had into a partnership that came to a brutal end,4,g1eywb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1eywb/i_invested_everything_i_had_into_a_partnership/,1,1586930755.0,"I have very high expectations of myself and I've struggled to fulfil them. I have two, now three athletic careers to look back at that ended in failure just before I reached the goals I had respectively pursued for years with 100% dedication, training 15-20 hours a week.

I'm over thirty now and my last shot of making it was taken away from me because my partner (non romantic) decided that what I was delivering wasn't good enough. Our coaches thought it was going well but for her it just wasn't enough. I trusted her 100% and she revealed from one day to the next that she didn't see any future in us working together.

Instead of letting me go she kept me around for three months saying that just because she doesn't see a future doesn't mean there isn't any. That made no sense to me but I got so depressed that I just hoped it would somehow work out.

Three months later I finally packed my shit and moved back home. It's so crushing to have somebody you did everything for tell you she accepts that you did everything you could but it just isn't enough.

Instead of giving me a way to save myself she insisted on explaining why it's me that isn't good enough and that's the reason it's not working. None of this ""it's not you, it's me or it's us"" or whatever you say when you try to let somebody down gently. Then I got an email detailing all the shit that's wrong with me. All she wanted was me to validate how she was feeling which was that my best is not enough. How the fuck can she not see how cruel that is?

I had just quit my job to pursue this dream full time but that didn't matter to her either. She refuses to accept that you have some responsibility for the well being of a partner who depends on you. She sees nothing wrong with how she acted because it wasn't her intention to hurt me, just an unfortunate side effect. Hitler also had reasons and in his mind good intentions. That's no excuse.

She also said that I made her quit me by getting injured and being low on energy (because of depression I had just started getting treatment for). Maybe rape is the wrong word but I feel brutally abused and while it was going on I was told that it's my fault and shame on me for making her do that.

I'm usually good at processing breakups but this time I just can't. I got even more severely depressed and I can't get these thoughts out of head. How could she do this to me? Everybody thinks she's nice and a great person. This was my last chance of achieving the greatness I have been dreaming of for 18 years. I've never been this close and now I'm left with nothing. My whole identity has evaporated and now I don't know how to fill the void. There is basically no chance to find a new partner at this level so everything I've worked for is fucked.

To me it feels like failure to get a job and live a ""normal life"". It's not who I want to be but I'm out of options because somebody took my last option from me. Now I'm too old to do what I really wanted to do. Part of me refuses to accept this.

I want to talk to a doctor but with all the COVID-19 stuff going on, it's not possible. I'm just reaching out right now for some help and I guess just to get an explanation for what I am feeling.

I am a 17 year old female.

In October, my boyfriend fell really badly. His parents weren't exactly there for him because they were upset with him about something. He wasn't my boyfriend at the time, but still my best friend. He fell on his back, broke his leg, had a concussion, sprained his wrist, etc. His back was in so much pain that he needed to be prescribed painkillers. He took oxycodone which helped with the pain a lot but the doctor actually overprescribed doses. He was taking more than he was supposed to without even realizing it. When the doctor did realize, he immediately canceled the next prescription he was supposed to pick up. He then started to experience withdrawal symptoms and they were BAD. At one point, I thought he was going to die. I used to spend hours taping his back, giving him the right medicines, helping him. Anytime that I wasn't helping him, I was just worrying. I know that what he was going through was horrible for him so I felt selfish ever expressing my feelings or telling anyone how stressed out and worried I was. Every time he told me a different symptom or something he was going through, I would just go to my room and cry and pray silently. I felt like it was selfish for me to worry in front of him. But, all the symptoms he had were things he just got lucky from not dying from. Since then, my attitude towards life significantly changed. He did get better but, he's still not perfect. I became a really negative person after this and basically just told myself that the worst case scenario was going to happen with everything in my life.

A while after this, we started dating. It was fine for a while and obviously we did what any teenage couple would (making out etc). But I have very strict parents. One day, they looked through my phone and found out about everything that happened while we were on vacation. They told me having a daughter like me was a mistake, threatened to kick me out, said I would be nothing but a failure in life. My father didnt speak to me for a while and it was a really difficult time for me. Despite how traditional my parents were, I had always had a close relationship with them and the stuff that they said to me in this time really really hurt. I'm playing down the things they said a lot out of respect for them but they were really really bad. It's something that I think about to this day. My parents have always held me to a high standard but some of the things they told me just put me down even more and increased this negative attitude I have towards life.

I went to my gynecologist for irregular periods and she asked me some other questions. I noticed that whenever my period cycle was about to start, I became super sad and detached and just went to a really bad place. I always thought it was PMS so I asked my doctor how to help with it. She asked me to explain some of my symptoms and after some time she said I could be experiencing PMDD (Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder) which is essentially a more heightened form of PMS, but can also mirror symptoms of depression. At this time, I was feeling different. I felt super sad a lot of the time and I really only talked to a couple people. Before this, I was probably the most outgoing and interactive person you'd meet. I was friends with everyone, out every weekend, and I also did really well in school. My junior year I got a 35 on the ACT and had a 4.5 GPA. But, once senior year rolled around, I had straight C's and really didn't care much about anything. I put all of this off as PMDD and my gynecologist did suggest going on birth control but my mother has always been against it so I didn't'.

In January, this sadness became increasingly worse. At this point, I really only talked to one person, my boyfriend. I tried to tell him what was going on but the words just couldn't come out of my mouth because honestly, even I didn't know what I was feeling. I just felt stuck and I just felt this lingering sadness and I didn't know exactly what it was coming from. One night, I began to feel like the room was spinning and I couldn't breathe. I started crying and struggling to breathe at the same time. I felt like I couldn't move almost. This lasted for about 25 minutes and after that I just sat there for a while. I became sadder and sadder the longer that I sat there and eventually I cut myself. If you asked me then, I couldn't have explained why I did that and even now I can't. It just happened so quickly. I just put a band-aid on it and forgot about it and didn't address it.

At this point, every little thing began to worry me. If I got a bad grade I thought colleges would rescind my acceptance. Everytime my mom called me downstairs I thought I was going to get kicked out. Everytime my boyfriend texted me, I thought something had happened and he was gone. Everytime anyone talked to me, I just couldn't hold a conversation and had no motivation to talk to them. It was senior year. This time last year, I imagined myself partying but here I am stressed about a hundred things that I have no explanation for.

The cutting continued. These episodes were I couldn't breathe or move did. I just didn't address it. I would try and get through it at home and put on a happy face when I talked to people in school. In March, I finally decided to address it. I knew I had to tell someone about it and reach out for help but I just couldn't. I was so embarrassed and honestly a part of me felt like I was just being overdramatic. I didn't know where this sadness was coming from. I constantly yelled at myself saying others have a lot more struggles than I do and I should be thankful. I was telling myself this, yet it still continued.

In March, all my friends began to hate me. They said that I ditched them for some boy and would ignore me every time they saw me. They'd talk shit about me to people, they used to flat out talk to each other about things that involved me when I was right there and never let me talk. It hurt me so much because I did not know what to do about it. One friend told me that I had never been there for her and I was a horrible friend that had no presence of mind or empathy for anyone. All this just hurt because before this year she was literally my best friend.

It was really hard for me to open up about this because even I didn't know what I was going through. But, one day I got the courage and talked to one of my friends about it and I apologized to her for not being there. All she responded with was, ""Everyone gets sad, you're not the only one. You think I wasn't sad when I didn't place first in track last week? It's always something with you"" and it just hurt me so so much. It had taken me so much to open up to someone and once I did she just put me down. And she discussed what I told her with so many people when all I was trying to do was confide in her and ask for some help. I decided then talking about it would help no one and resorted to cutting myself.

At this point, my boyfriend began to notice that something was wrong. He asked me and one day I just broke down and told him everything. I could barely breathe while talking to him and I began to say the same sentence to him, ""I don't want to be here."" Because honestly, I didn't. I kept telling myself. What was here for me? I'm not happy, my friends hate me, my parents will forever be disappointed in me, I didn't get into the college my parents wanted. There was nothing keeping me here. I just wanted to be gone and resorted to cutting. Once I told my boyfriend this, he was there for me. He used to stay on call with me for hours talking to me and comforting me. It really helped because after being put down by the girl I used to call my best friend, I just really needed some support. He was there for me every time he sensed something was wrong and I thank him for any improvement that I made. He has been struggling with depression since his injury so I didn't exactly know if I should open up to him knowing he had a lot going on that was worse than me.

Here I am today. I want to talk to a doctor about all this but I am not sure if its necessary. Am I being dramatic? Is all of this just me overreacting? Or could there actually be something going on? And if so, where could it have stemmed from? I was the happiest person last year and this year something just changed. I don't know what it was and I really just want some outside opinions right now. If you did read all this, thank you so much and any response would be super helpful to me.",Depression

At the same time I quit my Effexor. I had been on 75mg for 5 weeks. My doctor moved me up to 150. Two days into that and I was a mess. I think it was causing suicidal thoughts. I wanted to go back to being stable again, which I was much more so before I started taking the Effexor. So i stopped.

I still take Wellbutrin and Latuda and Amitriptyline along with sleep meds and clonazepam as needed. But I'm falling apart. I've barely stopped crying for 4 days. I have suicidal thoughts nonstop. I can't sleep. And now I've got brain zaps and nausea.

-Three year old me wants to be a prodigy

-Elementary school me didn’t do that, but bragged about it enough to not have friends until fifth grade

-I made friends for first time but I was the loser of a basketball clique

-I am fat

-I go to middle school, basketball clique is no more. I fail to force myself in to a anime/meme clique.

-I get depressed and act 2010 meme cringey but this girl is nice to me and ends up being the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. Good grades

-Next year of middle school, my grades are good, I get in to a clique about Anime/Memes (different one), no depression and playing football. However, the nice girl is now in highschool.

-Winter break at cadet thing, all of my friends stopped laughing at my jokes and awkward silence. Two of them get real passive aggressive and we don’t talking very much but we all pretend that I’m still am friends with everyone

-Here we are, me not wanting to say I am depressed because I always thought depressed people need to get over themselves. On the internet too much, feuding with my parents, no friends, terrible physique and terrible grades. I miss the girl that was nice to me, I should have appreciated her more. I am really sad and quarantine is preventing me from making any new friends. I have turned to both YouTube for therapy videos and discord for friends, those have failed me. 

- I have a tall, wide frame. I know I’m smart. I have all of this potential and I just can’t motivate myself into anything anymore. I find myself wasting entire days doing nothing. I am not suicidal, but I’ve thought about it in the past.

- I find myself unable to get anything done anymore, ever. My grades suck and I haven’t been able to do more than one assignment every forty eight for the past few months.",Depression

Going so crazy right now like how am I even supposed to be thankful??? I mean yes I can litteraly make a list of 100 things right now but the feeling of irritation everyday just always takes over?

Feel worse after depression medicine?,4,g1cze6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1cze6/feel_worse_after_depression_medicine/,3,1586924086.0,"I had a strange experience today. My job was getting me down as usual, so I took my prescribed depression medicine. I know it won't kick in til later, and I have to take it regularly.

Wasting resources,17,g1cz2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1cz2z/wasting_resources/,3,1586924059.0,"So, the reason I’m still alive is because I’m afraid committing will waste all the money and time my parents have spent to raise me.

I’m in college right now, majoring in something that will allow me to pay them back as quickly as possible (they didn’t ask for this; I just feel guilty for wasting their resources...). I’ve been struggling with depression since I was 7. Not sure why I felt like posting this today — it might be a bit of a rant after a couple of meetings where I felt like the dumbest person in the (virtual) room and this overwhelming emptiness that has been building up for a long time.

I haven't slept in days,3,g1cdig,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1cdig/i_havent_slept_in_days/,1,1586922155.0,"It's been a couple month since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.

Sorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.

Also I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.

My mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.

Edit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid.",Depression

Experiences with Viibryd or Cymbalta?,2,g1c7tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1c7tu/experiences_with_viibryd_or_cymbalta/,0,1586921660.0,"So far I've tried Effexor (no effect), Wellbutrin (no effect), and Zoloft. I took Zoloft at varying dosages, at some points alongside Wellbutrin. Zoloft helped with the extreme lows of depression, but I still felt significantly depressed in addition to feeling numb/flat, almost unable to fully experience happiness. I have been off medication entirely for around 6 months. In the last couple of months, I started going to the gym almost everyday, taking omega 3s, taking vitamin D, occasionally using light therapy, and trying to get my sleep schedule together. I was definitely still depressed but felt wayyy better than when I was on Zoloft. 

My mental health changed for the worse very suddenly though when an ex came back into my life (bringing up old wounds that haven't healed) at the same time this pandemic began. I ended up losing my job. I've been sleeping around 12 hours and once I wake up, lay in bed all day. I constantly feel like I'm going to cry, I've tried my best to continue exercising but I'm finding it very difficult. Yesterday I went for a walk/jog on a trail and ended up crying my eyes out (luckily I was alone in the middle of nowhere haha). I don't necessarily have a plan, but I think very often about killing or hurting myself. It's something I've caught myself fantasizing about often, even though I know it's not something I could go through with. 

I had a Facetime appointment with my PCP today. She prescribed me Viibryd, along with Zofran for the nausea side effects. She said if it was too expensive, we could try Cymbalta instead. I haven't gone to pick it up yet, but the Walgreens website says it's $71 with my insurance. I found a coupon I saw people mention online and am going to try to use it. I'm wondering though if Viibryd is worth the cost?  I've read good things about Viibryd from people who failed to respond to different antidepressants. I'm also wondering how people who don't respond to antidepressants like Cymbalta?

At that point in time over a couple of years my depression was incredibly horrible. I was so close to ending it all, it scares me to think about. 

I don’t know if it was the looming depression, maybe the weed I was excessively smoking, or the heavy drinking. I’m just shocked by the things I don’t remember-little things and huge life changing details of bad experiences. I also find it odd because I study psychology and there isn’t really such a thing as “blocking” it out I guess.

I've dealt with anxiety, destructive friendships, fear of going out of my house,bullying, a bitter divorce who left me as the only one to take care of my mom emotionally so I had to hide my feelings just to avoid my mom to get sad. In fact, when I finally hit rock bottom was so bad that I wished for my death. 

I've come out of them thanks to having friends and the improvement of the situation of me and my mom. But since, last year depression returned. First, it was realising how I chose a career that I ended up hating, then graduating and being unable to find a job. Then realising how my friendships had started to fade away as they are beginning to have relationships and it made me worry about a near future when I will be the only lonely guy of the group. 

It doesn't help that I feel my sexuality is a nightmare. I pray every night to be cured. I've been to lgbt groups but I just doesn't feel related to the things there, if anything it made me feel worse to be with people who put their sexuality as their main personality trait and it doesn't help that I live in such an homophobic country that coming out would cost me even the relationship with my mom, the only true love I have.  I don't think life would be better if I was straight as I already struggle with sharing my feelings and I'm not a very romantic person but at least I could live a normal life like the ones my friends are already having. Love is nothing more than an ilussion for sex. Isn't that's the reason why so many marriages fall apart?

And I don't think it will get better, if anything it will get worse as soon as my friends start to get married and having children. (In fairness, I would like to have a kid through adoption but I don't know if single parents can adopt). Having to live for a job I'll probably hate and now due to the economic crisis that the virus will cause around the world, my plan to study in Spain is likely delayed. I love my teenage years because at least being a top grades kid made my life have a meaning but now, it's sad to see even the kids who were my former bullies improving in their lifes.

So I just flick back through the same apps everyday, stuck in my head trying to control my hole life. I try to go for a walk everyday but I’m overthinking the whole time. Literally anything triggers me. Any decision I try to make ocd comes in and tries to force me into something I don’t want to do. I want toast? No ocd wants me to have cereal or something bad will happen. I want to message a friend? ocd wants me to send exactly the right message, normally something I don’t even want to say. Then I end up talking and talking and probably annoying people.

Then on top of the is the feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough. From years of bullying at school. Then the guilt for the nasty ways I treated my friends because I wanted to look cool so made fun of them. Knowing if I didn’t my best friend would get mad at me. Saying I didn’t like her for hanging round with them.

And finally there’s the years of abuse from my alcoholic mother. Leaving me on my own at night. Coming home all bruised and bleeding. Forcing me to hug her when I didn’t want to. Calling me a freak, a bitch, telling me to fuck off. Gaslighting me constantly. Trying to kill her self in front of me and screaming at me to give her pills.

anxious and probably schizophrenic thoughts? idk but needed to write this down,3,g1be7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1be7k/anxious_and_probably_schizophrenic_thoughts_idk/,0,1586919102.0,"I’ve been wondering what my real reason for committing suicide would be. I’d like to think that depression itself isn’t that big of an issue for me and wouldn’t be the reason for potential suicide.

I feel like if I ever did it, it would be because of the constant arguing and switching in my head, and also my consistently worsening grip on reality. It’s driving me insane and I hate living like this. This is mostly a post I’m making while having anxiety, so no I’m not talking about committing suicide right now I’m talking about the future.

I have a LOT of potential, and I have a lot of plans and methods that could get me successful and rich in the future, I know that and I know other people have told me that, the problem is I have no motivation to. And even if I do, first of all I’d have to get better.

What if I get better, end up thinking everything is fine, I move on with everything and eventually find a girlfriend, and I relapse into these same thoughts? Even if I do get better, I’m going to constantly live with the fear of a trigger activating and me lashing out.

The only reason I am seeking therapy right now is because some people believe I can be helped, even though I continue to believe I’m completely out of reach and beyond help at this point. I think there really is just a point where someone has been through so much that nobody is capable of helping them. 

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a big deal if I didn’t have certain triggers, because then my dark thoughts could be easily drowned out, but no, my mom had to be a despicable piece of shit and treat me horribly. And of course, dad was never there, and when he was, he was raping my mom and forced me to watch, so god knows what fucking psychological impact that had on my brain.

I’m not sure I can even push this shit out of my head. I’ve tried overpowering my triggers and telling myself “it’s fine it’s whatever it doesn’t matter you’ll get past it” and it just makes the triggers worse. 

It’s to the point where any amount, even an insignificant amount, of any representation of anxiety from rejection and abandonment, can set me off. Even if I wasn’t self isolating, I legitimately don’t understand basic, normal human interaction and I can barely even talk to anyone properly. I don’t know what normal friendships and relationships are. I’ve never known, and I don’t know what love is and I can’t love, which I’ve explained before I think.

Sorry I can’t really stick to one train of thought with these posts. I’ll be really surprised if someone can somehow get into my head, get past all the split personalities, get past all the manipulation and lying and fake personas, and convince ME that I can get better, that life is worth living, and that someday I won’t feel like such a danger.",Depression

I feel ashamed for writing this, but my mind is full of dark thoughts at the moment and I just want to get it off of my chest before i suffocate.

I am stuck at work at the moment I might need to put up an all-nighter since last week I could not get out of bed and I have fallen behind with Uni and work stuff. To be honest I am falling apart but I am a pretty good actor, so no one has noticed. My depression comes and goes, and this time its horrible. My whole body feels heavy, especially my chest, I can feel my heart pounding the whole time. 

My thoughts are racing and the only thing that I want is to go to bed, hide my head under the cushion, and cease to exist. The worst part is this feeling in my head and eyes.   
Do you know that feeling that you get when you are emotional, seconds before you start crying?  
Like when you are cutting onions and you try to hold your tears back. For some days I have been constantly feeling like that. It is truly horrible. I want to scream, hit the wall with my head until it stops and then some more.  
Aside from that I am a fucking Idiot, due to some stupid decisions I now only have around 15 euros in my bank account. I truly loath myself. If I could somehow get out of this body and be in the same room with myself, I would beat me up until I showed some of the drive that I used to have in my teens.  


My thoughts are not even that consistent at the moment. I can feel insanely sad and angry and then suddenly feel as dry as sand emotionally.  


I wish I had someone to share this to be honest, I wish I could would feel loved.   


As the sun is setting down and I am here alone, I have this faint voice that tells me to jump outside the window. But shit, have you ever tried jumping outside a window? Your whole body freezes and you can not move any muscles. Your hands get all tingly and sweaty, your skin cold. You breath slowly but heavily. Memories start to pop up in your head, of people who love you, mom, dad, friends.

I get out what I put in. I write long notes before each session but It dosent always help the conversation going.

My girlfriend needs help.,9,g1ar6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g1ar6u/my_girlfriend_needs_help/,4,1586917038.0,"Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. 

Reddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I’d support her no matter what.",Depression

I think her long illness and repeated improvements lulled me into a false sense of ""theres still time"".

My mother was put into hospice again on Friday April 3rd and told she had a ""few weeks"". This time I knew it was for real. I saw her on Saturday and on Monday and she seemed to be doing pretty well and she texted me on Wednesday saying that she felt she was going to linger a week or two more. Instead she died on Friday the 10th. 2 days after that text. She was only home a week before she died.

My sister flew in to be with her the second she was released from the hospital and put into hospice. I work in an ER so I am considered high risk in these COVID19 times so I just visited 2 times from the day she came home from the hospital to the day she died and both times I had to maintain some distance, I couldn't hug her, and my sister didn't want me staying very long (1-2 hours). I tried to see her on Thursday but she said she was too tired for a ""visit"". So I finally got fed up with not seeing her more and I applied for FMLA so I could be with her 100% until she died. Make more memories. Take care of her. Not just be a ""visitor"" but be her \*daughter\*. But the day I FINALLY decided to do that, the next day, thinking she had at least another week for me to be with her, she suddenly crashed and died. I waited too long. WHY DID I WAIT AT ALL? Why didn't I understand how little time she had left? Why did it even matter? Why didn't I call my work the second she got released from the hospital and said, ""I'm not coming back to work until she has passed, no matter how long that takes"" or just quit and told them to use my PTO to cover my last 2 weeks. The stupidest thing is, I was going to quit my job soon anyways because I'm going to grad school. I think I just got hung up on being afraid to lose my health insurance, or being unemployed for months, or thinking I couldn't be gone for weeks (when i thought she would last weeks). But none of those things actually mattered. I didn't even have a financial incentive to stay because my dad told me he would cover my expenses until I left for grad school if I wanted to quit. I thought about FMLA but didn't apply for it until it was too late.

I managed to get there in time to say my goodbyes, I got to tell her I loved her and she managed to say it back, and I stayed with her in her final hours although she was heavily sedated. But I cant forgive myself for not being there with her in those last days. I COULD'VE BEEN THERE, getting hugs and watching tv with her and saying goodnight to her in person every single night.....and I wasn't. She probably thought I cared more about my stupid fucking job than her.

I just don't understand how stupid I was. Why did I keep delaying leaving my job, when I was going to quit soon anyways? Why did I assume she had weeks, I should've known she could die at any minute? Why didn't I press my sister to let me be there more? Why was I ever content with ""visits""? Why didn't I even consider being there 24/7 until it was too late?

I have no real good excuse for why I didn't quit, why I wasn't there with her. I honestly don't understand what I was thinking.

I could’ve been there and I wasn't. Day after day. I'll never be able to forgive myself. All the time and memories lost. I could've gotten hugs. I can't even remember the last time I got a hug from my mother because of COVID19.

I come from a very loving family, who gave me the best life and love possible. But for as long as I can remember (until recently, more about that later) and according to my parents I had anxiety starting at age 2. This impacted me on a completely different scale that I can't barely begin to describe. I hated myself. I hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I walked. You name it, I hated it. This day to day alienation of myself as a person stopped me from living a normal child's life. I never signed up for sports, or for music or nothing. I never had the confidence to even take the chance - because I always felt that I was so wrong the less chance I had to be wrong the easier my life would be. I would turn down birthday parties and other social events because I didn't want to say something or be judged or make a bad impression etc. I remember in my first year of primary school, we were played this movie about an orphanage, who had a caregiver who banned all stuffed animals and teddys (probably not the best movie to show to a bunch of 5 years old). This lady hated them so much she would burn them and make the kids watch. I can vividly remember coming home that day, quiet, acting like it was a normal school day - but there was one thought I could never clear my head off. The burning of the toys. It wasn't until that night and from memory about two months after where I would hide my stuffed animals under my pillow when I went to bed, and kept myself awake - on guard almost in case such a thing happened to me as well. That is something my parents never found out about. At the age of five, I can remember being worried that my house was going to burn down in my sleep, to the point where I would keep all my most treasured belongings in plastic bags, ready to flee the house with. I can remember being scared that someone was going to murder me in my sleep or kidnap me and hold me hostage till the day I die. I suffered from much more intense and violent nightmares than my peers. The thing that I am still confused about, is that despite that I lives in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country and had a caring family, was that I still suffered from these things. I was so worried about things getting broken or something going wrong, that despite how desperately I wanted something to work or happen, I was too scared of failure to even try in the first place. I was always trying to be the happy/friendly kid, just for the sake of everyone else which made sadly too much sense at the time, but now it makes no sense..

Like all people (i hope) we carry burdens. My burdens was that my grandfather died when I was seven, due to cancer. The day of his funeral, I was asked by my parents if I wanted to go and I was so worried about looking weak and upset, that I went to school like it was a normal day, while the rest of my family faced something I can't even imagine now. I remember hating myself for years and years over that decision, because I loved him to bits and I never got the chance to say goodbye. My only memory of him is me returning home from school that day, and my dad showing ""program"" and me seeing his photo on the front page. I have never been to his grave since because a) I am to scared to ask my parents where it is because I am worried about opening up and b) the fear that it will worsen my feelings now. My lack of attendance at his funeral ate me away inside for years, I remember weeks on end where I would cry myself to sleep in silence each night, but never told my parents and still haven't. It was only when I had a breakdown in I think at the start of Grade 8 when I only told my mum half the story, the regret. Not the amount of pain it caused me. I don't think I'll ever be able to tell them because it sounds just too pathetic. 

&#x200B;

It wasn't the middle of Grade 8, that I began to get a grip back on my life. At my school, in eight grade it was compulsory to take a performing arts subject, this could either be music, art, drama or dance. You could either do two arts for one semester each or one for the whole academic year. So I choose 1 semester of drama and 1 semester on dance. I only choose these because I didn't know what else to do. These classes were mixed gender, which I found really hard because for Grade 1-5 I was at a mixed gender school and then 6-7 I was at a boys only. I found it hard because I had barely settled in and any sense of security or even a wall to hide behind was completely removed. I found the first few weeks of the course really hard, could barley look anyone straight in the eyes and mumbled my way through every social situation, even if it was a simple ""Hey! How are you?"". I just couldn't do it. I remember considering dropping out and changing to music, and my mum said to me ""Just give it some time, it will be fine."" And I have been so happy that I listened to that advice. I owe my happiness and emotional freedom in life to my drama teacher, she pushed me and pushed me, to achieve confidence and it payed off. It was so successful to the point where I changed to a full year course, took for the whole year in Grade 9 and the same in Grade 10. I even signed up for the school's musical which sadly got cancelled, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

However, despite that I now have been dealing with the same sort of issues/dreams/constant pessimism again like when I was five. Recently, I have been so worried about death due to the coronavirus that on a frequent level I am having dreams involving comas, death of whole family etc. I seem to be more and more often wishing I wasn't who I am. On a frequent scale, I think to myself ""Imagine how good my life would be if I was born in the UK"" etc. Sometimes I wish I am a celebrity or sadly just someone who gets heaps of attention. 

&#x200B;

I know that I just dumped a lot of stuff on you guys but here are the main questions I need answered please:

&#x200B;

* How do I make up for that lost time, I spent worrying about everything?
* What do I do about my grandfather.
* What do I do about wishing I was someone else.

I’m losing patience with my mother.,2,g19abz,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g19abz/im_losing_patience_with_my_mother/,0,1586912369.0,"My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”",Depression
My suicidal/depressed GF hates me/pushes me away can meds save her?,3,g17nav,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g17nav/my_suicidaldepressed_gf_hates_mepushes_me_away/,1,1586907075.0,"Its been a very rough couple of months, especially with this corona forcing us to be together when she 'hates me'.

Quick summary: S.O. of three years has had a history of depression and I think it is very bad right now (seeing a psychiatrist this week, makes constant suicidal thoughts). Our first year was really great but she got pregnant accidentally, it was stressful but we moved in together and started making it work. Ever since she was pregnant, and even after baby our relationship has been on a downward trajectory (sometimes it had highlights).

Specifically some major things are our intimacy fell off a cliff (which has been huge for me, she says I am gross, doesnt find me attractive, 'not a real man' etc), she tears me down a lot, says I am stupid, lazy, NEVER wants to hug/kiss/hold hands, tells me she hates my family (we are living with them right now for free for the last half year, and they really went out of their way to try to make her feel welcome), doesnt like doing anything fun any more, ALWAYS wants to fight etc etc.

I am not perfect at all, and I have gone way out of my way to listen to her, to fix whatever she is angry about and all it does is make her want more and more. We had a huge fight (seems like 1/week honestly) where she saw I was texting my sister and friends asking for relationship advice and had some huge melt down that I 'betrayed her' and she took baby and drove a few hours to her parents and said she is never coming back and I can get baby in a week.

My question is can depression 'change' someone this much? She was once very loving, very caring, someone I ENJOYED being with. These days it feels like I am just care taking someone on the verge of admitted self-destruction. I feel trapped because we have a kid together. I truly want it to work out, but likewise if she really just 'hates me', doesnt want to hold hands, thinks I am so stupid and gross not sure what future there is. I am secretly hoping this isn't the 'real her'. Can you guys give me a little insight? Thanks",Depression

With that realization i also realized that i’ll never be anything either. I’ll be just like him, just a regular person who will live a regular life and then die and be forgotten.

Around a week ago, I made a post on how I wanted to delete my memories and stuff because my life was cringe, and every action I make, I think it's cringe. I'm a gamer, but I restart video games often. I don't like the save files there. Even if I restart, I think it's still cringy, and I want to restart again! Plus, I have OCD hand washing problems. And I am autistic, so some of this may be dramatic. And I think that deleting my memories would be the perfect way to cure this ""mini-depression"" before it gets worse.

While I was a happy ""child"", and now in my teenage years, I'm a bit depressed, it might just get worse. I have a terrible attitude, and I've been trying to ""change"" it since July 2017, but it keeps getting worse. And with this STUPID COVID-19 existing, forcing me to use the confusing program known as ""Microsoft Teams"" instead of just going to my Special Needs class at my High School, I keep missing stuff, since I don't use my iPad that my schoolwork is on every day. And I could change that. But I won't.

And now, my stupid mother decided that I should ""heal my hands"", so she got rid of my soap and water. They may look terrible, but I'm gonna fucking die now. She doesn't know about how big this mistake is. And I could had avoided all of this bullshit this morning! But I didn't. Instead, I was stupid. I woke my mom up instead of using the other soap. I am so fucking useless. Now I have to limit my bathroom uses, because of her. You see, I had pee problems since I was 7. And no matter how many squares of Toilet Paper I use, pee goes on my hands just from WIPING it. My mom thinks I piss myself, when in reality, I don't. Pee just goes on my hands from wiping it. And I can't wash my hands off. So now my hands have to be dirty, and they'll smell like shit as well. All because of my fucking mother. I fucking hate her.

But, if I delete my memories, then I won't have to deal with any of this! Then I won't restart my games, and think it's ""Cringe"" when I first start them, since I won't remember playing them again! Then I won't know everything I touch will smell like shit since I won't be smelling my hands one-thousand fucking times in a few seconds. Then I'll be even more stupid as fuck, so then I can become smarter! Then, my body won't be stupid as well, and maybe it could reconnect to my brain again! AND THEN MAYBE I'LL FINALLY STOP MAKING CRINGY CHOICES, GET RID OF THIS DEPRESSION BEFORE IT STARTS, AND FINALLY BE A FUCKING GENIUS LIKE I WAS MENT TO BE! I HAD ENOUGH OF MY FUCKING LIFE! I NEED WAYS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MY MEMORIES RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

IF YOU TELL ME TO CHANGE, I WILL JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE, SINCE I'M A FUCKING STUPID CUNT WHO NEEDS HER MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE!

I AM FUCKING LOSING MY SANITY AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE!

I JUST WANT MY MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE AND PERISH FOREVER IN AN ABYSS THAT WILL SOON BE ERASED!

I have fostered dogs on and off for years and I’ve never had a tough time passing the dog on to it’s new owner. But for some reason this last dog I had was just special. I’ve been caught in the worst depression I’ve ever had in my life and because of quarantine we were able to spend every second together for three weeks. Every day I’d take him to the park and watch him play for a few hours, we’d play together at home and snuggle in my bed. I was always sneaking him bits of my food. He was just such a good dog and I really wanted to adopt him but I can’t because once I go back to work I won’t have the time for him. He left yesterday and I cried all night just wanting him here so bad. I feel devastated. How can I get over this?

I have some honestly incredible friends who I can normally talk this through with, but the stars are aligning in all the worst ways and they're all in terrible places, going through much worse shit than me at the moment. Last thing they need to hear is someone else's negativity right now. 

To keep it simple, for the last eight nights, I've been having panic attacks whenever I settle for bed and then nightmares. It's literally come out of nowhere. I'm no stranger to panic attacks, but I usually only get them in social situations, and nightmares haven't really bothered me much before. I haven't been able to sleep any more than three or fours hours each night, and on two nights, I've just given up and spent time on my computer mid-morning. 

I think it's just lots of little anxieties and worries building up, but the suddenness of it's floored me. I honestly don't know what to do. Been in touch with a doc about it via text (my university medical centre) and all I got back was a link to an online resource about improving your sleep hygiene. I guess the quarantine situation means I can't reasonably expect much on that front, which I understand and respect, but it still feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth. Country's facing some nightmarish shit at the moment but having no medical guidance for it doesn't put any smiles on my face.

I'm trying not to fall into a self-pity hole, but I was honestly not doing *too* bad until I woke up today. I was feeling shit all week, but rolling out of bed and socialising at least one friend each day to keep myself distracted. Today, I immediately just felt like a lemming as I opened my eyes, like I want to just go hurl myself off a bridge. I've got friends in a Discord call right now who I could go join, but I feel so groggy and snappy that socialising is starting to feel like a worse and worse idea the more I think about it.

I know it's just my brain being an utter dick to me plus my body crashing hard from the bad sleep, but I feel really stuck in this slump because of that.

I see on here a lot that a lot of people tend to isolate themselves anyways due to their depression. I have the opposite problem.

I hang out with my family (My parents, grandma, and a couple cousins I'm close with) and my boyfriend. I work 48 hours a week and on my off days I'm usually with my boyfriend, at one of my parent's house or at one of my two cousin's houses.

This quarantine is making me crazy and I'm starting to get really depressed. I was still hanging out with my boyfriend and parents since I've been laid off but now that the stay at home order (I live in Michigan) is starting to get more strict I've been trying to be more safe. 

My parents last week told me they don't want me over anymore for a bit (which I understand). My boyfriend was over yesterday and I told him I don't want him over anymore for a bit (I don't really have a for sure time line right now, but probably until the stay at home order is no longer in effect) because he's still working. If he wasn't working I wouldn't mind but he works with other people and I know he's not being as cautious as he should be (Not wearing mask and gloves). 

I live alone and don't really have any hobbies. All I've been doing when I'm not with my parents is watching TV, reading, going for walks, and playing around on my phone. All of that stuff was getting boring anyways but I at least was able to break it up a bit by seeing my parents and having my boyfriend over. Now I can't do that so I'm just gonna be doing the same few boring things every day. I live alone too so I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I had the talk with my boyfriend Sunday and decided to have him stay over one more night (yesterday) and then no more for awhile. All I've done the last couple days is cry. All I think about is being alone the next few weeks. I feel like I'm not gonna make it.

By saying suicide is never the solution is to imply that there is no amount of human suffering beyond which continued suffering is less humane than death.  I believe that such a point does exist and once past it suicide should not be discouraged.  Of course while you are suffering it is easy to think you are past that point when you are not so that determination can be quite difficult.

Today is a turning point, where I've lost the majority of my hope. It is now time to plan my next steps seriously. I pos this on the off chance my plan can provide someone guidance on the next steps of their life. And perhaps as an immutable record on the www. Maybe I am crying out to the world? Who knows?

I've been fighting to repair things with my wife for months after another traumatic event, the passing of my mum. In a short span I've lost my wife, my mum, my home, my future, my dreams and soon my childhood home as my dad sells the place.

I've done things wrong by my wife and was too ignorant and self absorbed to realise the signs. Even when she clearly pointed it out to me. I recognise its my fault now; I was too focused on what I thought she wanted and not what she told me she needed, and too lazy and dumb to carefully ponder her words. The best I can do now is to ensure that when I leave she is well cared for financially and that I've done all the things I've said I would to make her home perfect.

After this I will give away the majority of my things; there is no meaning to collecting things without having a home to store them or someone to share them with. Years of work and money wasted hoarding things for a future that will never see the light of day. Alas, fate and hindsight be a fickle beast.

Finally I will leave and volunteer in an impoverished nation to give someone a chance as happiness as penance for destroying my wife's happiness. Maybe I will die here from crime or illness. But at least I will have made a positive impact on someone. Who knows I might feel like I deserve happiness again.

What I will not do is leave without giving back to the world and balancing the scales. There is too much sadness in the world as it is. I have no hope for heaven but maybe this will absolve some of my sins.

I know this is selfish to my family, but my sis has her partner and my dad will have my sister. Sometimes we have to do what will bring us peace be it momentary or eternal.

I hope someone else find solace in the below excerpt of Dylan Thomas's famous poetry. The complete poetry isn't relevant to me but certain sections call out to my situation. It has given me and continues to give me strength in times of weakness, fighting for the courage to do good and remain hopeful as oppose to acting on my sucidal ideation.

""Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",Depression

It was the only social contact I had. My coworkers and I weren't friends, but I was around people and didn't just stare at the wall all day. I miss hearing other people's voices so much. 

I live with my parents and we have a terrible relationship that makes me extremely lonely. My mom has slight agoraphobia so I was forced to stay inside my entire childhood. I'm getting triggered and am intensely lonely.

I've always used tinder but now have been using it obsessively. I'm not attractive but am photogenic. I got out of an abusive relationship this past year which has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I'm extremely self-conscious. 

I started talking to this one guy for a while through text/phone calls. He asked to videochat and I said ""I feel like you're not going to like me once you see me out of pictures."" (I had been snapchatting him and he definitely got pictures of my body. So he was aware of what my body looked like). But I'm carrying a lot of face weight that isn't shown in selfies and I have some acne and indents (which he knew about too). 

He assured me it wouldn't be an issue and he wanted to make me feel good about myself. He said we were a great fit emotionally and sexually (sexting). He found me attractive. So I agreed.

We videochatted and it went well. I enjoyed it and actually liked him more. Well, low and behold, he's instantly not into me anymore. I asked why and he wouldn't give me a reason even when I pressed. So naturally, we know what it is.

That gutted me. 

He was SO into me before. And then it instantly switched off for him.

Now my brain is going a million miles a minute. It's telling me that my abusive relationship was the best one I'll ever have. Which I've always believed. I mean honestly, that man is the only one who loved me for me. He cared about me more than my parents. He was my only friend for the last three years. I called him and asked to get back together. He said no.

I know I need to lose so much weight and get botox and make major improvements to my physical appearance in order to have anyone even consider liking me. But I also know that's not possible. I'm never going to lose this weight and I just don't have the money.

So now my brain is telling me I have to get used to the fact that I'll never have a boyfriend again, which means no husband/kids. I've never been successful with making friends. I'm trying to accept the fact that I will always be completely alone. And I just wish I could. I've been crying nonstop since Sunday. 

And I'm expected to work through all of this. I'm expected to be more productive than usual in order to keep my job. I literally can't even keep myself alive.

To provide some background, I (34F) was sexually abused by my parents since I was 10 (continued until I was around 26, when I cut them off) and I was bullied during elementary school. Everyone always told me I’m too pessimistic, too negative, and cry too much. I suspected I had depression but never had psychiatric exams. Even when I was in elementary school, I had some thoughts like “I won’t have to be worried/scared/sad anymore if I die.” 

I went NC with my parents about 8 years ago, which is when I first met my husband (my then first boyfriend). My husband made me realize that my parents are toxic.  It’s interesting how I thought my parents were loving, good, “model” parents back then. The crazy thing is I still miss them sometimes.

Things got better after a while, I have a decent job that pays well and just bought a house this year. Despite all these “positives”, I still fantasize about sleeping forever or not exiting in this world. This especially happens when I have arguments with my husband. I guess you could say the only positive existence in my life is my husband (and my dog).

Whenever I “fight” with my husband, even though they are all small arguments, I feel like the world is not worth living and I constantly find myself looking up ways to end my life. I spend hours (usually for 3-8 hours at a time) reading about various methods of suicide that have/haven’t been successful. It came close the other day, when I was testing a belt on a wall hook to see if I could hang there for at least 10 mins without falling. But then I remembered reading about how hung corpses are gruesome and it’ll traumatize whoever finds the corpse, and I didn’t want my husband/dog going through that. 

I went to various therapists and psychiatrist before and they haven’t been that helpful. I’m tired of talking about my past at this point. I’m tired of crying. Husband still wants me to give it another try, possibly get on depression meds. Last time I took Zoloft, it didn’t seem to really help, but I can’t tell for sure since the doctor prescribed me a “pediatric” dose (I’m small).

How do I stop dwelling on suicidal thoughts? The world doesn’t seem that great and if it wasn’t for my husband, I’d probably just die.

I have never really been the type to be Depressed, I have always been a very optimistic and confident  guy. As of late with this whole Coronavirus pandemic i have been feeling the loss of interest in participating in society and maybe even being alive.

This infuriates me because someone can just as easily look this up online without putting themselves or my co workers and I in danger. and for as long as there are people like that i dont see the situation getting any better.

I've been in the house for 3 weeks just me and kids because my wife is a key worker. Now, I love my kids but I am not the stay at home type. I've always been the strict parent with a short fuse and my patience has been worn away to nothing. I find myself shouting at my kids and wife. I hate it. It makes me feel worthless that I can't even be nice to my family.

I grew up with a family that has strict ideas of what a man should do and be so I've never really able to manage my emotions. I just stuffed them down until they burst over. I struggle to talk to people even at the best of times, never at the worst. 

I know this is a bit of a ramble and I apologise but can anyone suggest anything to help everything stop weighing so much? I need to drag myself up because this can't go on.",Depression

All my life, I’ve experienced this feeling of confusion, dumbness and brain fog. Since I was a kid, I’ve experienced major anxiety and depression and I wonder if this has a lot to do with it? Ive always had a HUGE problem not being able to learn anything at school. Being in an environment with so many others allowed my anxiety to almost completely numb my brain out.  
My anxiety and stress got so bad in middle school that I developed psychosis (possible schizophrenia) for 3 years and I never told anyone about it. It really physically felt like my brain was changing form or melting.
In college, it was all the same. I’m 21 now, and It’s as if my confusion and IQ worsened so much. I couldn’t learn anything, including basic knowledge. When people would talk to me I couldn’t process it-I can’t even say a proper sentence correctly without pausing as I speak and having to try my hardest to word it correctly. I made so many unbelievably stupid mistakes, I became so forgetful and my movements slowed. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be successful at school or learn how to drive a car. There’s no motivation for me to make a plan for my future or maintain my hygiene. I don’t know what to do. I am really convinced that my brain may be rotting. My brain always becomes confused and then starts to ache really bad like it’s shutting down. I feel like dying because I don’t think I can ever be cured from something like this.

  I don't know where to begin. Life has been pretty rough lately, it has been for everyone. I've been working as much as possible so I don't lose my mind with everything that has happened within the past two months. The best conclusion I can currently come up with to make myself feel better is plan for the future. We hope (my household), with our stimulus checks, we can move out of the motel we're currently living in. Since I am also still working and receiving a paycheck, I intend to use this money towards fixing my teeth and getting a phone. I intend to help my best friend get her license and a car in the both of our names. Eventually, we're going to move out of state together. We can't figure out where yet, but that doesn't matter. We're making goals and we're planning and we're working and waiting. That's all we can do, right now.

 On a sadder note, I'm learning to not cry as often. Which doesn't sound sadder, by any means. But I kind of feel like it could be. Numb has always been worse because it just makes the days go faster, it doesn't take away that looming sense of doom in the back of my head. Or take your face away when I close my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I know I'll be okay. I just need to listen to 'I see a light' by Hank Williams on repeat and keep reminding myself what I need to do. If the harsh things I've been through have taught me anything, it's to learn to love and let go. And the best way I know how right now, is to just hope that someday, you'll be proud of me. That also keeps me going a little bit. That's what helps me accept what has happened. Instead of convincing myself I'm horrible and letting myself rot in my own little shell like I have so many times in the past before, once I started to, it woke me up.

I am always finding ways to escape this constant feeling of sadness, but it always catches up. Sometimes you have the will to fight it, but when everything you try and do fails or makes things worse, I reluctantly start to thing it is best to do nothing. But doing nothing doesn't help either.

I didnt start taking treatment seriously until I was 20. This year I turn 22. My psychiatrist explained to me that because I had gone for so long without treatment, my brain has essentially rewired itself to insufficiently process reward chemicals, and that I would need to take medication for potentially multiple years before going back to normal. She said that, perhaps, I never could go back to normal.

Quite frankly, it's been so long that ""normal"" for me feels like being depressed.

It took time for me to experiment around with different medications and dosages until I found the pairing that really helped (Welbutrin 300mg and Zoloft 100mg if you're curious.) When I start taking the medication, I start feeling great after about a month. That terrible feeling in my chest is gone. My suicidal thoughts are suppressed. It feels like I can actually talk to other people.

But every time... after about 3 months or so, I start feeling like I'm not myself anymore. I feel like the medication took apart of me away. Almost like being depressed is a part of who I am. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they told me I'm stupid for feeling that way. Am I actually stupid? Am I alone in this feeling?

It feels cathartic to be depressed and to cry and cut myself. Everytime I start up my medication, i have to resist the urge to stop. Before I'd started taking again, I told my psychiatrist how I felt, and all she said was that I need to fight the urge to stop. She explain that the more times I stop and start the medication, the less effective it will be the next time. And if I keep this cycle up, I may cause irreparable damage to my brain's reward system.

I'm fighting the urge again. I'm starting to miss feeling hopeless and miserable. And in a way, I feel hopeless and miserable not feeling that way anymore.

A lot of people do that. You don't have that. The only way therapy is paid by insurance is if a doctor recommends it. If I told a doctor everything I'd be sent to a mental hospital.

I've been told I don't need medication by a school assigned councler. Maybe I don't because I'm already going numb emotionally. Maybe when I'm finally 18 I'll get help. What if I'm unhelpable by then. What do I have to do for people to take me seriously. Do I have to threaten my life just to have a professional that I can talk to.

I dont want to be diagnosed that i am depressed, but i just want some answers, just to know how to deal with it and how to accept what i am feeling, i just dont know.

Okay so whats my mood. Firstly i have never been truly happy, well the world is amazing and all, but nothing really made me happy ever. I dont say that i dont get happy, but just never that much happy, that i would say i was trully happy, maybe its normal i dont know. Sometimes there are days, like this day, when i just want to die, i really would love to kill myself. I made plans on how i would kill myself, a couple of plans, because when i go to bed, i start to think of a plan on how to kill myself, its just a thing my brain does most of the times i go to bed. I dont think that killing myself would be a bad thing, i feel such a weak person and also dont want to live, so why not leave this life and let others live it, who want to live, i just feel that i just take up space for people who want to live, for people who are trully happy. I just feel really weak and a coward on not just doing it. I thought about it for the last 13 years of my life, so maybe the time has come and i just need to do it, i just need to have some balls and just freaking kill myself. I just dont see the point of living if i dont want to, there are people who wants to live and dreams big and are happy, so i just want to give them the space for it.

This year...,6,g12cjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g12cjb/this_year/,2,1586884769.0,"It was going to be one of the greatest years of my life. 2019 had been one of the worst years I've ever been through. Depression, suicidal thought (almost daily), strained relationship with my father, the death of my dog (who's saved me from ending it earlier in my life), my ""best friend"" consistently being a dick to me throughout the entire year, etc. etc. etc.

Somehow, in january this year, something snapped in me. I was going to turn 2020 into the best year of my life. I started eating better and exercising more, already lost nearly 17 kg so far, I started practising my social skills more, I made sure I got a promotion at work. But then, it all got turned upside down in a heartbeat.

This Corona pandemic has ruined everything. My biggest hobby, which is going to concerts, has now been taken away from me, paranoia within my family has risen to a point where the toxicity levels are at an all time high and now my grandmother, who is one of the only people I've ever felt close with, is in the hospital. Suffering from Corona with a very slim chance of survival.

The one time in my life where I actually got motivated, started bettering myself and was going to make my way out of depression and anxiety so that in the future, I wouldn't have to go through my entire life alone anymore, I could maybe get in a relationship without messing it up due to anxiety and make some connections with people. The one time I started getting a little better everything turned to shit. Just like it always seems to do. Now I've slid back into a depression that's possibly worse than ever before. It's like I've been destined to be taken down to the ground on every step my entire life. I know there's way bigger problems going on in the world right now, but this is just how I feel right now.

messy thoughts/the beginning (rant),3,g11x33,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g11x33/messy_thoughtsthe_beginning_rant/,2,1586882456.0,"i have been depressed for the last 4-5 years. it's not a constant depression. sometimes it hits for months. sometimes it hits for days.  i would guess it in my last year of middle school.  i would be senior in high school now but i dropped out. my life isn't the worst nor best. i am grateful to my mom for what she provided me in life and i don't blame her for my depression at least not anymore. but in her eyes she has done nothing but help me. she has told me from the beginning that she has done everything to help me. i don't know maybe in her eyes she has. unfortunately i have never felt that way. now she has helped me find therapists and got me on meds before. she has always made sure the family was okay.  and please note that i do love her.

my depression started when i became more conscious of myself. i hated how i looked. my mom has a habit of making passive aggressive comments. such as ""you're eating a lot lately"" ""looks like you put on some weight"" ""you're too skinny""  ""you should year make up to hide your acne"". i remember she would physically pin me down and pop my pimples, even when i resisted and cried. i don't remember exactly when but at some point a little before high school i decided to change how i dressed and looked. i had short hair since i was in 5th grade but now i cut in shorter. i wore baggier clothes. and i changed my name as well. i hated my name back then. she named me unity because i brought the family together.  it never felt that way when my dad and step dad left. i started smoking a lot of weed. i skipped most of my classes. i finished freshman hear with a GPA of 1.6 i think. i remember taking pain meds to get out of Spanish class. i started self harming that year too. i would even do it in class on occasion if i was feeling really bad. i wore hoodies everyday. i remember my step dad was the first to find out. he grabbed me and pulled up my sleeve. 

that was also the year i first attempted. it was a weak attempt. i took my mom's pain pills she got from knee surgery. i took whatever pills i could find. i was home alone that night. i took them. i felt so sick. i went and passed out in bed. i really hoped not to see tomorrow i tried 2 days before my 14th birthday. i did wake up, around 3 am i threw up a lot. it hurt so much. i didn't have the energy to clean it up. i went back to sleep. 

as i said before i was going through a point in my life where i changed my identity. so i was not wearing dresses or skirts. i had my best friend over. i don't know what we were doing. we were just hanging out in the room. my mom wanted us to wear skirts for some reason. when we refused she yelled at us the slammed the door locking us in. every time my mom raises her voice even to this day i jolt and cower. i hated my mom for how she yelled at my friend. if it was just me there it would have been fine. i'm used to her yelling at me. but why did she have to yell at my friend.  my friend never came over again.  she was my first real friend.  my mom blamed me for it. saying i should've just worn a skirt. 

later on my step dad lost his job. this ended up making my mom decide to move. meaning i would be leaving my best friend. we had moved many many times before but it got a lot hard in high school.  i cried the whole drive. she told us it was for our own good. we needed to be closer to family. it would be a fresh start. she never liked any of my friends anyway. she didn't like any of my choice and i do admit not all were good. 

my new school was nice. i luckily made friends quickly. this was my first indoor school. it was very interesting. the layout was easy understand. i was probably the happiest here. i was still depressed but i was better. i had an art class that i mostly enjoyed the teacher was at times strict. i made her cry because one of my pieces. it was a pretty emotional piece. she hung it up in the library.

My relationship with my father has been horrible for most of my life, but recently it's gotten worse to the point that I don't even try to connect with him or talk to him at all if I don't have to. Even that is too much of a bother to him, though; a few days ago I overheard him complaining to my stepmom that I keep talking to him, saying that I'm annoying and am always trying to get his attention and interrupt his games, and telling her how disrespectful it is that I talk while he has headphones on (for the record, all I say is ""Hey, Dad!"").

You know what I dared inconvenience him with?

I was taking the dog for a walk since she hadn't been out all morning, and he had her in his office.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There are days on end where we don't talk at all, and I bother him too much?! It's completely ridiculous. I can't believe I was stupid enough to move back in here, but now I can't leave because the rent went up too much for him to pay on his own when he moved, and my stepmother and brother can't make up the difference, and even if I knew they were okay, I have no money saved up and I barely make enough to even afford to rent a room somewhere.

Am I falling back in?,1,g11cgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g11cgw/am_i_falling_back_in/,0,1586879383.0,"So it’s been a long while since I’ve had time with my own thoughts, but now obviously I have more time than I know what to do with. Someone could argue _too_ much time. I know it’s cliché, “this too shall pass, it’s normal to feel sad/anxious right now,” but I was really _really_ looking forward to getting my life on track this year. I finally started saving up to move into my own place, finally looking for a career, finally about to actually graduate instead of walking on a stage. 

Instead, now I’m staying at home wondering when I’ll ever be able to see another face again. I’m stuck worrying if my parents are going to be okay not just financially but also health wise. I say I’m going to keep reading, learning how to code, yatta yatta... but it all just bores me now after a few minutes. I sit at home, maybe go for a run if I’m feeling really shitty, but for the most part i skip meals and lose sleep every night (hence my 4am post). I haven’t showered in days.. My mood changes constantly from irritated one minute, to crying in my sheets the next, then suddenly I’m back on my Netflix binge like it never even happened. I’m also quick to have a glass of wine (or 4), or maybe I’ll go to the gas station and buy yet another vape stick flavored just like mint even though the last time I bought one was “definitely the last time,” or maybe I’ll just keep smoking weed and just numb my emotions for another day longer. I can’t seem to shake it anymore. I don’t know why I’m like this. 

I’ve suffered too long from anxiety, I don’t want to fall back into these same patterns. I want to be better but I just can’t help but think of all the shit going wrong. Am I ever going to get my job back? Will my family be okay? My grandmother just got out of the hospital and is back to living by herself how is she doing? Will I ever get my unemployment benefits? Will society go back to normal, even after this is over? Why am I still thinking about my ex who I know is an asshole and dumped me over 6 months ago? Why am I thinking about how the only people I’ve ever been romantically attracted to, always turn out wrong? Maybe I’m not meant to find love. Maybe I’m not meant to live the life I’ve wanted to. Maybe things would be better if it all ended. What’s the point in waking up tomorrow just to do it all over again? I guess my birthday is coming up this week.. but is that even something I can look forward to in a time like this?

Abandonment issues,2,g11567,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g11567/abandonment_issues/,1,1586878322.0,"Been quite depressed for the past 6 month, wouldn't go as far as saying I am doing a depression but I'm definitely not ok. 

I (23F) have lots of friends (which I am grateful for) but I just don't feel close to any of them and I'm always scared they are going to abandon me. I was getting my sh\*t together but Corona time and being stuck at home had put me right back down. I've had many people abandoning me, hence the issues. I sometime find it funny to write them because there's just so much it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me or if I'm just cursed.

\-Back in the days when I was about 15, I got in a fight with my best friend at the time and she turned everyone against me so that I got kicked out of the group (At 15, those friends were my only friends) There were about 17 people in this group and I'm still friend with 3 of them.

\-My ex-boyfriend (worst thing that ever happen to me) broke up with me but kept telling me he loved me and wanted to come back with me for 2 years after the breakup when we had been dating for 1 year only. Being young, dumb and in love I waited but he was just using me.

\-I moved to another country quite far and the girl that I considered my best friend told me after a bit that I was downgraded to just a friend.

\-My best friend of 2 years told me he had feelings for me and didn't want me around because he was scared he would do something he'd regret, he also had depression but I couldn't help him since he did not want me around. He pretty much broke up with me at that point. 4 month after while on a road trip with 6 friends he snapped and yelled at me telling me the last good memory he had with me was from 1.5 year prior. I had no idea he was resenting me that much until he said so. 

\-My other ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks after my best friend did the same and told me after 1 year of dating that he never loved me and was waiting for feeling to develop but it never did. 

My best friend and my boyfriend both broke up with me within 2 weeks so did not have a lot of people I could talk to.

Add on top of that my family problems because I still live at home with both my parents, my university problems since I can't seem to be able to focus and do enough work, the fact that I can not climb anymore (my passion and stress relief activity) and you get a good idea while I'm feeling this way

Ever since learning about it and becoming diagnosed with it by my local health department, I have progressively debilitating memory, my ability to do basic responsibilities (taking care of the family pets, brushing my teeth) has become hellishly hard, and to my surprise, I have lost myself in this dark, but strangely comforting abyss.

I have been taking Wellbutrin (150mg) for about a month or longer, sometimes missing days and sometimes even with the knowledge that I need to take them by getting out of the bed, forget about it entirely. Initially when getting into antidepressants, my mother noted my eyes were clear, and I was more lively.

But now...I feel as if I have slowly faultered off it's effectiveness. Though it made me periodically happy, it never got me to the point where I wanted to take action in life. Really, nothing changed.

My entire decision on taking Wellbutrin over other depressants was to conserve a source of energy I have plenty of - sexual. Reading on Reddit and especially doing the research, I found that most SSRIs kill libido, which though not very sexually active with others, is a high driving force that I've yet to control.

Sometimes spikes of energy hit me enough to get a little bit done, but at the most inconvenient times (the sudden invigoration to clean out my whole closet at bedtime).

But despite all this, I have become selfish and irrationally jealous and angry at the success of people who seem to have everything together. I know they don't, but they act so well like they do. I dream of the day where I can draw and write of a quality that yawns a jaw wide, dream to feel sexy and wanted, dream to feel love. I have a family that cares about me, but I don't feel that except for my mother. I have several people on my friend's list and yet I feel completely alone. 

I have completely secluded myself from Twitter from artists I enjoy because I am now jealous that the beauty they create completely squanders any characters, worlds, ideas or more that I could ever create. I am weeks behind on class work at my college. I have never felt so powerless. I even - without conscious thought, bought a BB gun to practice overcoming the fear of death. I bought pellets and metal targets to persuade my parents into thinking I wanted to pass the time, but the purpose and practice of me fingergunning my head, into my mouth or under the chin had and still is a constant pastime.

Depression is piloting me into hell, and I just don't know where to start. Journaling feels seldom an idea that works, people say they are there for me to talk to, but I never can get the words out or I feel they would never understand.

Anytime anyone says everything will be alright, I feel myself go semi-ballistic. Anytime anyone asks too many questions that are of the same caliber just differently worded, the same happens. I lash out verbally, often.

I created this account not as a pity party or to be babied. But as a way to get a direct answer and order to follow so that I can push myself to remember who I am, to condition myself to never be jealous or envious of the art around me and realize I can make something just as beautiful, and how to condition and steel myself to deal with moments like this where I could crash again.

Around 2 years back i was a very happy person and out of the blue my mind just went completely blank. I couldn’t talk to people because there was nothing in my mind and as a result I became very anxious and insecure. I skipped a lot of school and found myself becoming an emotional person out of nowhere. I was crying at movies and stuff like that. I was honestly confused more than anything as to why I was feeling this way and I kept trying to write it off as an off day but this lasted maybe ~5 months. 

I found some ways to deal with it so I wasn’t as hopeless but I still felt happy at times throughout those months and I still do now and I don’t know if what I think is “depression” is just a natural circumstantial emotional response. For instance I really don’t like myself but it’s just because I do things that are annoying, so is my low self esteem just a natural product of that instead of me having depression? Like if I was very likable and was popular and pretty I don’t think I’d be “depressed”.

Terror,2,g10d3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g10d3g/terror/,0,1586874495.0,"I want to leave something behind, but I can’t seem to begin to build anything. I want to love, but I can’t be loved back—not wholly, not unconditionally, the way I want to love.

I used to not care, but only recently, I learned what it means to give a damn about yourself. I almost wish I hadn’t come to that realization. It forces me to see that almost everyone else begins with this condition—knowing intuitively it is not only acceptable but perhaps even imperative to love the self. In the grand scheme, it is perhaps both inconsequential and myopic to obsess over such trivial matters; but I’ve chosen to disregard this truth as a result of the aforementioned realization.

I learned someone loved me, but they can’t fully love me, at least not now, at least not without consequences. It would be a disaster, but I pray for that disaster to materialize. The mere thought of building a new life from the scattered debris of a ravaged tower is perhaps a delusion, but that delusion is all I have; so I cling to it, even if it makes me appear a desperate, lonely madman, which is what I must confess I have recently been reduced to.

She has her obligation, which I understood from the beginning, something I never thought she or I could overcome—until recently, when she and I became closer then I ever could have imagined. I’ll remain distant, I bargained, until the storm passes, if it passes at all; but I was warned maintaining such distance as a matter of volition was an impossibility, at which point I resigned myself to the contemptible verity that I am merely a laborer of my own mind’s undiscerning whims.

How does one break free under such conditions? Once again surrender to that ever-encroaching pit of stagnation? Pray for the annihilation of that which will never be broken? Or battle through the biological impulse to remain alive for the benefit of all who secretly despise you?

I was obsessed with standing out to him so he would like me, but everytime I talked to him I would come out awkward and shy. Last year, 11th grade, I walked back from the counselors office crying. I was put down by the counselor being  condescending. Through walking that hall all I wanted was Mr.C to be there. I wanted him to comfort me and tell me everything was going to be alright. I looked down as I cried when all of a sudden I see Mr.C turning the corner. I became shy and anxious. I remember him noticing me crying. He said ""How are you""in a sympathetic voice. I managed to mumble out a broken ""good"" as I swiftly walked past him. He said ""good, that's great"" and walked past me. That was it. No comfort, no acknowledgement, nothing. I walked to my class and he continued on his way. I wonder if he ever looked back. If he ever cared to ask me what was really wrong. Last year he got engaged. I was happy for him but jealous. Not of his wife but of his children who will grow up with a great dad. He moved to a different school this year and probably forgot my name.",Depression

I always wanted to die and I hate my life every single day even the small things to the big things at my point make me think that. I was always a happy looking person, but deep down I am a dead body buried deep down the soil in a coffin. I have always wanted to kill myself but if I did what would happen. First of all, nobody would believe the fact I killed myself, and they would wonder why. Normally, I look like a normal person outside since I would not express myself a lot to other people. I might leave my family and my friends and they would be sad and depressed and now that would cause more and more and more never ending problems. You see you are being controlled by this world this hell like society forcing you to do things you don’t like and brainwashing you. But there is also another thing that is torturing you, it belongs to you but somehow you cannot control it. It is your feelings, you might wonder, why? Here, let me explain, so look at why you wont kill yourself since it is because the society brainwashed you saying that it is bad and cowardly, and by leaving your family behind and feelings will make you *feel* guilty. The reason you didn’t do the things you love is because this society and the devil feelings is controlling you right now. Everything you know, everything you say is controlled by feelings and society. So lets look at this shit at the other angle. What if, you just got cancer, out of nowhere, it happened and you would die. That would be great but that is where feelings would come in and start torturing you. You wouldn’t want to leave your family behind but you wanted to die which in this scenario it have accomplished your dreams for you. But sometimes a person’s feelings is an angel to them they would do anything to make themselves happy. Now that is where society comes in and starts torturing them. Wanna know why? Here, since they would do anything to fill their joy and if an *angel feeling* person killed themselves since they wouldn’t think too much and that will lead to trouble for people around him. Sounds bad right, it sounds bad because society brainwashed you. It wants you to think the way that you weren’t supposed to think. Why is life hard, it is because of the modern society and depression is becoming more common and more common because of all these shit. The feelings, the stress, the people are all because of this society. Why would your feelings become a devil trying to make you think the other way. You were born in this horrible society, it is how it worked when you were born. And fuck it, fuck this society, fuck this world, fuck everything I own, fuck you god, why would this happen to us at this specific time. Why would these rare angel feelings exist, maybe some people think the other way, for some reason, these people think the other way when they are born. Or, maybe they developed other things living here in this hell but really rare. It matters the most about how you wanted to think and this world controls that. It is making you depressed and it is making us bad. Well, at the end of this long crap which might be bad, I hope you would find yourself a better future, and think that the reason of living is not because of money since the society is like that, the society make life worth money and a lot of people including me wants to end it.

One of the worst symptoms I think I experience is irritability and anger. It is just out of hand at this point. 

I mainly divert my anger towardd my family and never my friends or strangers or classmates. 

But I lash out terribly at them , especially my mom. My poor mom. It gets rough sometimes, and it really only just starts with me back talking. Which will then result in her talking back to me sometimes and then I will completely lose my shit, and just shout or swear. 

I dont ever usually yell any insults directed towards her, I will usually just mindlessly yell about my anger, or sometimes I will yell at her blaming her for how I am now, or yell at her over a stupid argument over something like a cup, etc.. alongside that, if I am in a bad mood I will just snap back at her my response instead of responding like a civilized person.

I feel bad, but In the moment I do not always feel bad. I have a hard time finding a healthy outlet for my thoughts so i personally believe that it comes expressed through aggression.

It is usually that I am sensitive and I just pick fights with everyone in the house. 

Its terrible because I know I'm being a pain in the ass, but it's worse because I dont have it under control and im putting people I care about under unacceptable remarks and a bitchy attitude all because I had a bad day.

Is this something meant for anger management?
Are there any mechanisms that can get me to stop myself before I lash out? To recognize that there are innocent people I deeply care about in front of me and that I shouldn't act that way towards them? I can feel my rage unnecessarily build up in the moment and then before I know it, it unleashes on everyone.",Depression

At school, I isolate myself because I don´t want to make myself look like a fool trying to talk to someone. Making friends is something I don´t try anymore because I rarely make friends when I try to talk to someone. Whenever I do try people look at me try to talk and mix up my words and just look weird. So I don´t try anymore. I just wait until someone comes up and tries to talk to me. I rarely have someone come up and talk to me. There´s this one girl that loves to mess with me. She lives close to me so that´s not good. Basically she´s made me into her ¨servent¨ because I lost to her in something that was important. My family would leave the house to me on the weekends because they would go to my grandmother´s place and she has a cat and I´m allergic to cats. This girl would go to my house on the weekends when my family left. When she would come in it would basically be her in my room sitting on my bed talking about her life and all the drama she´s facing while making fun of me as I´m lying in my bed. I don´t tell my parents because I enjoy her company even though she´s mean to me. Before I counting you on, I know this story isn´t that depressing but I want to entertain the people who are having hard times and make them feel better.

I’ve grown up my whole life afraid, afraid of what people might think, or do, or might act. If I don’t do the right thing I’ll get punished, or yelled at. Maybe I’ll be kicked out and not able to finish school. I worry often, about everything. The only reason I’m alive is cause my brother and sister but mainly my cat. My cat has been missing for weeks and I played it off as I couldn’t help it, like it’s not my fault. Today, I was doing my online classes and biology sucks. Finally I just broke down, all my stress I’ve been keeping in, my thoughts, my sadness. I just cried, and I cried, at first I blamed it on my biology homework but I know that it was deeper than that. I kinda laid in my bed for the last few hours just, waiting, for nothing.

My window has a ledge off it where I can go put on, if I fell I wouldn’t die but would definitely get hurt. But I can also climb higher up. Anyway, I’ve always been scared to do anything “bad” because what if I get caught? What if the moment I decide to do something someone catches me or shows up? The neighbors? Anyone. But tonight I opened my window, I crawled out and I sat against my window. I played my music. I felt like at any moment I could slip from this ledge and... if I fell, I’d be caught. Not even concerned for myself. And I sat there, and I laughed. I laughed for a good five minutes. My legs were trembling and I laughed.

I don’t know if I have deeper root problems or something but, that’s the first time I ever did anything “bad” like sneaking out or what not. I felt crazy for laughing, but it felt so good. 

Shortened: I’m a goody two shoes with depression and tonight I did something I usually wouldn’t and I laughed and don’t think that’s normal but it felt good:)

Id like to add, I hope this post isn’t offensive and you think I’m just some teen who had a moment and thought she was depressed. I’d like to clarify I’ve been suicidal, scared and depressed since I was 12 years old. (Just for clarifications sake idk? I just feel like I have to explain myself?

I love you. I really do and I've known you such a long time.

I wanted to tell you those months ago. I've wanted to tell you all this time...and now you keep on hitting up my phone, like I'll be working in the city next year with you. 

And all I can think about is what would it be like?

It hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can't be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that. Would drugs make drowning less painful?

What about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.

A frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you wouldn't even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.

But what about mom? and grandma? or even Dad, even though I hate him? Or the dog?

God I love you, that subtle way you flirt with these messages, you, laughing at my stupid jokes and me, so impotent, so awed by you that I cannot act. You are beautiful the way you are now.

* my depression is contagious. i have inherited it from my father who is sadly depressed for the last 20 years.
* i am 22. my father got depressed because of career disappointment, hardships, family struggle and underachievement. he was devastated when all his hard work went into vain.
* he stopped socializing, remains silent, lost in thoughts, blames others, doesn't take responsibility, panics a lot, no joy, no happiness in life, never travels, never goes out except for work, doesn't speak much and also gets angry at us if we enjoy ourselves. he makes us feel guilty for enjoying the life and being happy, threatens suicide. it is clear that failure and embarrassment have ruined his self esteem and self worth.
* not achieving his desired job had ruined his life. while growing up, i was told that this is my father's ""personality"" by my mother (who is a little narcissistic, blames my father for not getting a good job, always concerned about herself, doesn't listen to him talking, victim mentality, superiority complex, puts others down, overly criticizing and controlling nature, thinks she is too good for others, in the 23 years of their marriage my parents have NEVER NEVER EVER talked because my mother thinks that emotions are drama and only ""useless people talk about emotional stuff"" and she is too smart and optimistic to get serious).
* okay. both my parents are victims of life. while my father is sure rude, but failure kills you and i don't know if i should blame him. mother, on the other hand, is caring but doesn't sympathize with my father. she thinks of herself as a human while all others as animals. as if she is a victim in every case and others are her enemies. she expects others to behave well, but she can be childish, crying, shouting, and then threatens us that we will face our fate when we have our own kids.
* i see that the rest of my family who are successful in life have qualities very different from us: they are self assured, sympathetic, cheerful, good at socializing, take responsibility, think that everything is possible, have large social circle (we don't), encourage and believe in their children, doesn't put themselves down in front of others, don't threaten suicide, travel a lot, live lie to the fullest wherever they are. they also talk to their children (my parents don't) and encourage them to achieve great heights, when in problems they don't cry and moan, but look for solutions, stay chill and take control. on the other hand, my father goes into panic mode and blames others and seeks help from others for his problems. he stays distant in social gatherings and stays aloof in a corner.
* sadly my father has never got help for depression. no one even cares about him and that he has depression. i don't know if even he knows whether he has it. he is done with life. since my mother doesn't love him and he doesn't love my mother, their lives are miserable.",Depression

Husband was next to me asleep like usual. He never hears her cry at night. I soothe her, go back to bed. Can't sleep. This has been my life for the last few months. I am exhausted but can't sleep. During the day I can barely keep my eyes open. During the day I am working from home like  most people are during this pandemic. When I try to take a nap, there is too much noise going on so can't really get a solid nap in either if I do fall asleep. 

On top of that, I have several things I have been dealing with: 

\- I have depression for which I take antidepressants. These antidepressants give me the side effect of dilating one pupil more than the other and causes me headaches. I wear glasses to help combat the headache. I can't really stop taking the antidepressants cause you should never go cold turkey on them. 

\- I've also been having a thyroid issue. It's enlarged and will need to be partly removed in June (hopefully, if it doesn't get canceled due to Corona). I've been feeling like I'm going through menopause: Sweating, hot flashes, emotional, ... I'm 28 years old ... 

\- Got scoliosis and kyphosis. Used to go to the chiropractor for treatment but since the pandemic I can't and I've been having muscle spasms and pretty bad back pain. 

\- My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer spread to the liver and peritoneum. She got her 5th chemo a week ago. She's doing well but we're currently not speaking of her being cured or being able to have the operation to remove the ovaries and cancer. 

\- My husband has PTSD (Army veteran) and has depression. Takes antidepressants as well as I do. No side effects luckily but he's usually quite negative, easily discouraged and likes to game all day every day if I let him. He moved to my country with me and the daughter for a better life and his integration program has been postponed due to Corona. He's not happy having to wait, he wants to work so bad. 

This pandemic has me worried. I am always super careful, keep my distance, wear gloves, wear a mask, wash my hands when I come in and use handsanitizer, immediately shower right after coming back and then I allow myself to go say hi to my mom and my daughter (we all live in the same household btw). I am terrified ... What if I picked up the virus but don't know, what if I give it to my mom with stage 4 cancer, what if I give it to my daughter or my husband. I don't know if my mom would survive it in her condition ... So much anxiety ... 

I would love to hear some tips and tricks on how to be able to get some sleep and calm myself down enough so I don't go absolutely insane. 2020 has been awful so far and I am expecting to see the 4 horsemen and Cthulhu this year at this point. Thank you guys for reading!

TLDR: 28 year old with depression, antidepressants causing pupil issues and headaches, thyroid issues, scoliosis and kyphosis, my mom with stage 4 cancer, an 18 month old and an immigrant stay-at-home husband with PTSD would like some advice on how to be able to finally get some well needed sleep!",Depression

How can I tell if I'm still depressed if I've been depressed for most of my life?,5,g0ytd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0ytd2/how_can_i_tell_if_im_still_depressed_if_ive_been/,1,1586867167.0,"I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since about 4 or 5 years old. I think so because I don't remember ever feeling happy or content as a child and all of my earliest memories feel off somehow when I think about them. I always felt bored with everything and thought that I didn't know how to smile. I realized I was depressed when I was about 6. I don't know how I knew what depression was but I knew I had it. I hated myself, thought constantly about dying, suffered from intense loneliness, thought I was unlovable, just wanted to disappear. Fortunately, I've never self harmed.

I've never been officially diagnosed. Never opened up about it when it was at its worst. Lived with it up through high school and into college. At some point in high school it got easier, I guess because I started making friends but I just seemed to be incapable of keeping friendships. I used to agonize over losing my friendships or having none at all but now I accept that it's the way life is. People come and go all the time.

At some point in college I finally started feeling better about myself, feeling confident, finally got a girlfriend. I felt like depression was behind me and I had the tools to fight it back if it ever reared its head again. But I never found motivation to do anything with my life.

In the last several years I've maintained a few close friendships because I've felt I don't need that many. But in the last year and a half I lost all of them from separate incidents and in some way I was to blame for each one. And then I broke up with my girlfriend because she wasn't putting any effort into our relationship. She developed feelings for someone else and realized she never had those feelings for me to begin with.

So now here I am, recently turned 30, feeling like I'm better off alone even though I really don't want to be, feeling like my life experiences have now proven to me beyond doubt I'll never belong anywhere or with anyone, people are probably better off without me, and I'm sad about it all but not soul-crushing sad like when I was a kid. I've begrudgingly accepted it. I don't feel numb. Just a sad sort of neutral. And I have no direction in life, nothing to live for. I don't really think about suicide. I feel like I'm just a leaf floating down the river of life, wanting to be more, wishing to have more, but knowing I probably never will. Just drifting along in life.

And I can't tell if I'm even depressed anymore. I've looked at some quick online tests but they're all like ""do you feel like life is pointless?"" ""Do you have thoughts of suicide?"" ""Do you feel sad all the time?"" They feel like the wrong questions. I feel like I might be depressed but it doesn't feel like the same kind of depression I've known my whole life.",Depression
A survivor,1,g0yrwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0yrwu/a_survivor/,0,1586867011.0,"Dealing with depression is always a battle. For a 42yo guy like me, I have suffered since I was a pre-teen. There have been events in my life where I almost said ""That's it. I've had it"". 

But I'm posting to let you know that there is a light at the end of that deep dark tunnel or in some cases sunshine behind that grey cloud. 

How I have survived bipolar depression.
1. I say this to myself every morning in the mirror: ""I love myself. I love my job. I love my family. I love my life.""

2. I surround myself with light. What I mean by that is I laugh. Laughter not only forces that sour down expression to change. It releases a chemical to the brain that seems to counter act the gloomy feeling.

3. I have hobbies. From video gaming to crocheting. I keep busy. 

4. I have a Rose and Thorn coversation. Rose=the good things. Thorn= the bad things. 

5. I change those thorns to roses.

6. I remember a wise drag queen once said, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you going to love someone else."" She also said, ""You are your own worst saboteur. Don't let yourself get in your own way."" 

7. I talk to my mother, who also suffers from depression. We battle this together. 

8. I find joy ever in the smallest things. Like reading my favorite book or watching my favorite movie. Book=The Chronicals of Narnia. Movie= The Last Unicorn. 

9. I listen to inspirational music. 

10. Yes, this helps, I don't know why, but I cry. 

The reason why I am posting this is because what is going on this day in age, where isolation and social distancing has become the norm. More often then naught depression is the feeling of emptiness hopelessness, and loneliness. But you know what, it doesnt have to be. We can battle together. 

Stay strong. We can and will do this together. There is no cure, but together we can push back the dark and let the light shine through.

Help,2,g0yq6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0yq6p/depression_overtaking_anxiety_help/,1,1586866824.0,"**(20 F)** so basically, I have really bad anxiety since 8th grade, mind you, I am 20 now.

I'm already a homebody but having to strictly do online courses for uni and being away from literally anyone supportive is hard. I honestly don't have friends and all this time I've been spending it in the same corner of my bed, thinking. Countless nights staring at the wall, I can't sleep, etc. I don't want to admit this but at the same time I'm concerned, I've fallen into a really bad spiral. I noticed that instead of worrying about things that could happen (the anxiety part), it evolved into accepting everything bad HAS and WILL happen. I have barely been eating anything for 5 days, even if i try I really just can't, the taste is bland and makes me want to puke, so I don't eat. I try so hard but I cant get past maybe a slice of toast and yogurt.

The Beauty in Tragedy,0,g0ymkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0ymkf/the_beauty_in_tragedy/,0,1586866395.0,"
""Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""- Scott Fitzgerald

Idk why I'm posting this, just kind of felt like getting some things off my chest anonymously. 

I believe that tragedy, as awful as it is, can lead to a more beautiful life. The great thing about hitting rock bottom, is that once you're there and you can't go any lower, from that point on you can only do two things: stay at the bottom, or rise. 
Everyone faces hardship in their life, some more difficult and trying than others, whether that be the death of a loved one, drug abuse, family or marriage issues, we all face it at some point or another. 
This world is dark and cruel, and it shows no mercy. If you let it, this world will consume you. But if you let your hardships transform you instead of destroy you, you can create the best version of yourself that you have ever been. Tough times make stronger people, and the more resilient you become to this world, the better. 
In my personal experience, these last few years in my life haven't been very fun to say the least. I had knee and shoulder surgery which at the time disqualified me from the military (which was what I had always wanted to do since I was a kid), My dad almost died from medical malpractice, I lost my mother and aunt to suicide 6 months apart, found out my girlfriend of almost 3 years at the time was cheating on me, went through a horrible breakup, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, got kicked out of my house several times and slept in my car in an Arby's parking lot, gained a shit ton of weight, and lost some of my best friends. I completely let myself go as a person.

One day I had just had enough of the mental torment I was in, so I put a gun in my mouth. I sat there in my car for hours trying to get myself to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it. That's when I realized that if I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger then, I could never convince myself to do it in the future. That was my rock bottom. 

I didn't kill myself, but I killed the old version of myself. I decided from that day on to the future, I would work on becoming the person I had always wanted to be, and let my trauma mold me into a better person. 

3 years later, I've come to terms with the death of my mother and no longer blame myself, I don't use drugs anymore, gained control of my drinking habits, went from being 245lbs to 190lbs and in-shape, and I even joined the Army like I had always wanted to. I gained control of my depression and now live a much better life. Honest to God, I haven't had the thought of suicide cross my mind since that day in the Arby's parking lot. 

The way I try to look at life is like this: always appreciate the good times and cherish them, because you could always have it worse. Don't be in a state of constant self pity, because it wouldn't take long to see someone else that has things much worse. I'm sure some of you have had a rougher time in life than I ever had, or could even imagine. 

Dark humor is something that I truly embrace now. Some will say that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I disagree. You can't take life too seriously, you just have to roll with the punches. 

Today I'm thankful that I'm alive, breathing, and able to see the world with two eyes and a healthy body and mind. 

Be your own hero, and aspire to be the type of person you wanted to be as a kid. Use your past trauma to mold you into what you want to be.

Create something beautiful out of your tragedy.

Please share your thoughts and insight, I'm always open to listen and learn. Maybe you'll help or inspire someone else that might come across this and read it, who knows.",Depression

He hit me today and i hit him back. But because he cornered me and refused to let me leave i stupidly reported him to the police. Theyve arrested him and im regretting it all. I would never take him to court. I hate his guts but love him with all my soul as well. I feel so guilty that im at home in bed whilst he spends a night in a cell. We were both at wrong. 
Without him im nothing. Im worthless. I doubt he will even want to speak to me when hes released. I contacted the police and told them i dont want to press charges or proceed further. But because of protocol they have to send someone out to me in the morning so hes in there all night. 

Without him theres nothing worth living for. No morning cuddles and him comforting after my night terrors. No more late night tv sessions or kitchen dance parties.

I don't even know what I want to say.  I just feel like I need someone to talk to.  Cliche won't do.  What I'm feeling can't be wrapped up in that kind of package.  I like to be heard and felt and cliche is neither.  How can I be so damn lucky in life and still  have so many moments of misery?  I guess that is the nature of depression.  Anytime the pain lasts this long it is bound to happen.  What is weird is that we are in the middle of this damn quarantine and that isn't what is bothering me.  Everyone feels so alone right now and maybe that is what is the most depressing.  Nothing feels different to me.  Through either self-isolation or a lack of concern from friends I've been alone for a long time.  I can't include anyone in this.  Not really include them anyways.  I can tell them what I've been through with basic descriptions and labels.  I can say I've been hospitalized for depression.  I cannot and would not invite them into my world so that they could truly understand my feelings.  To understand this, one would have to empathetically sink a little into some very dark and uncomfortable feelings.  That is like asking someone to voluntarily join you in your nightmare.  I don't even want to be in my nightmare, I would never ask a loved one to come with me.  There are coping skills for this.  Things I am supposed to do that helps me ride out the storm.  They give you a boat and oars, tools to navigate these waters, but sometimes you can look right at the oars, feel the boat rocking under you and not have the will, energy, desire to take hold of the oars.  Sometimes the water looks like the right and only answer.  Just fall overboard and sink as far away as possible.  That is when you take the oars anyways.  Because you remember.  A child's face.  A distant memory.  Empathy for the pain of others.  Even good days when this feeling is almost forgotten.  Stroke.  My son's first crawl.  Stroke.  My wife's warm skin.  Stroke.  My daughters first dance.  Stroke.  I will laugh at something again.  Stroke.  I am strong enough.  Stroke.  There IS value in me.  STROKE.  THIS GOD FORSAKEN FEELING WILL NOT BEAT ME.  STROKE.  FUCK YOU PAIN.  STROKE.  STROKE.  I AM A FIGHTER.  A GLADIATOR.  STROKE!   STROKE!  STROKE!

I started dating someone in High School who had a lot of issues. They were heavily abused as a child and had just no understanding of normal- or how not to be violent. I stayed with this person. I saw the person behind the rage and I knew I liked them, but I was young. When I graduated I moved out to go to school in the same area he lived in. I moved in with him. He proceeded to destroy me. From my confidence to my self worth and my trust of other people. Piece by piece he picked me apart. He reduced me to numbness, to isolation.

But here's where things get a little more interesting.

About six years into our relationship, I told him I couldn't take it any more. After countless nights of sitting with him while he cried, coming home to find him half way off the balcony (We were 17 stories up), being screamed at for not doing the dishes, being yelled at for just not understanding, having things thrown at me and being kept up until 3am most nights when I worked a 6am-2pm job six days a week, I just could not take it. I told him I loved him, but if he could not go and get help and figure this shit out I was leaving. We had a huge fight, but the following day he asked me to make him a Doctor's appointment, because he was too afraid. He got anti-depressants. Things started to change.

It's been almost eight years since that fight. We are still together. He changed himself completely over that time. Went to therapy, got a handle on why he was treating people the way he did. It's been a couple of years since he had any major issues, and I am definitely much happier. I am very proud of how far he's come. The amount of work it took for him to get where he is and the battle he faces every day thanks to the things his awful family did to him is humbling. It offers a certain amount of comfort, knowing I was enough to change for. But there are a few issues.

I went through all of that with him. We have been together about 12 years in total and friends for over 16 years. I wasn't about to make him go through that horror all by himself. But in the process, I've done myself so much damage. I have horrific memories of that abuse, including the few times he got physical. His rage caused a lot of black outs, so he doesn't remember most of it (I need to make it clear, he does not use this as an excuse. He has owned up to everything I've told him about, and he knows there is more). The problem is more or less me. Every time I tell him about something, every time I tell him about a fight we had or a time he made me really uncomfortable, the guilt he feels is very clear. He tries hard not to get too down, because he knows I don;t enjoy making him sad, but he has a lot of regrets from that time.

The issue has become that I can't talk to him about it. This man has been through 13 years of physical, sexual, mental and emotional abuse. He has dealt with all of this once before. Coming back through it with me is just re-triggering things I don't ant to see him go through again. He's tried his best to be supportive, but between the fear I gained of communicating with him over the first part of our relationship and my concerns about his mental health, I can't talk to him. But over the course of helping him, I distanced myself from my friends and family to keep them safe and to better contain the situation. these people also do not know the extent of the things that happen and I don't want them to think about him that way. He really is a very mice person now, having worked hard to be that way. But knowing what he did, most people cannot look passed it.

I just don't know where to go from here. I have no one to talk to, but these memories are eating me alive. I've scared all the time and when I panic I get sucked back into those moments. He asks me what's wrong- I just can't tell him. I can't sleep, I barely eat because I feel ugly and I am constantly frustrated. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I have 2 herniated disks from the aforementioned full time work and I have a brain injury that causes extra mood swings and cognitive issues. He cares for me, he helps me and he keeps things clean. He tries, but I'm so wrapped up in the past I have a hard time even getting involved in our new relationship. I'm not sure what to do from here...

&#x200B;

Edit: I super appreciate all the support but I need to note for clarity and to avoid too many repeats: As stated above I am disabled and thus unable to work. I do not have any money and my partner is currently in education to get a decent career to support us. We live on about $1000 a month, plus food donations from family. So right now, I cannot afford therapy. We have considered both therapy for me, and couples therapy but cannot currently afford it. When he went through therapy I was fortunate enough to still be employed and had a decent benefits package that allowed for that for my spouse. I lost those benefits in 2015 when I was laid off from the job that allowed for those things, and at the time I Was dealing with his issues and so did not go through my own healing.",Depression

Anything I post on my social media accounts are completely ignored by everyone. I have no one to talk to. I feel like no one gives a shit. My best friend is in a different state and super bad at texting, so having an actual conversation with her is pretty much impossible these days, I've never had the kind of relationship with my parents to where I feel comfortable talking to them about anything really, I'm not in school and I have extreme social anxiety so I have no way of meeting people my age, and making online friends has always felt weird to me, I get along with my coworkers but I don't know them well enough to confide in them and I'm too scared to try and get close to them, and talking to my therapist just isn't the same as having a friend. I'll probably never date because guys have never liked me, and no one would ever be able to put up with me. I've never even had a real relationship so I don't know how to. And like I said, there's really no way to meet people my age here, and dating apps scare me, not to mention they're only for hookups and I hate hook up culture. So basically that's why I'm here. I literally have nowhere else to get everything off my chest and I feel like it's killing me. This is probably going to be pretty long so I'll be shocked if anyone actually reads through it all.

I'm 20(f), turning 21 soon. I went to college for a year before dropping out, and shortly after my family moved to a new state. I thought it would be a fresh start, but instead I'm cut off from everything I ever knew. I got my first job last summer, it pays well, but the living cost where I am is ridiculous, so I can't afford to move out. I have no real skills and have a difficult time completing/understanding the simplest tasks, so I know I'll never be able to have any job other than minimum wage service industry, and I absolutely would not be able to handle the stress of a second job. Because of that, I'm afraid I'll never be able to move out. I can't afford to move out on my own, and finding a roommate seems impossible. You have to pay for every single roommate finding app/website, and like I said, I have social anxiety, so I'd have to know someone extremely well to be able to live with them. I'm also a more conservative person, and every person my age, (especially in my area) smokes weed, drinks waaay too much, and is very aggressive about politics (I don't like talking about politics to anyone, not even people I trust). I also have no credit score, and no renters history, so idk how I'd get an apartment even if I could find a roommate. 

Living with my parents is becoming a living hell. They treat me like a child, and always have. They don't listen to a single thing I say, they don't understand me, my depression and anxiety, or even really seem to try to. I haven't been able to grow up because they won't let me. I pretty much don't know how to do anything myself, and I can't ask them for help because they tell me I should teach myself, which I've never been able to teach myself anything. I did my taxes for the first time this year and they had to walk me through it. I can't budget. I don't understand the stock market, or credit scores, or anything at all to do with money. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety because Idk what to buy. I'll be covered by their insurance till I'm 25, but I have no idea what I'll do when that happens because Idk how to go about choosing insurance plans/companies. I have a hard time making appointments for myself because talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety. I don't know anything about politics. Trying to learn any of this is just so overwhelming I can't handle it and I just shut down. So basically I am actually just a fucking child and there's not a single thing I know how to do.

How could there possibly be a future for me? I'm stupid, don't know how to do anything on my own, will never be able to make more than minimum wage, will never be able to move out, can hardly take care of myself, can't make friends, will never find love. I don't know how I can have any kind of life worth living. I feel like I'll be living in my tiny bedroom in my parents house, single with no friends until I die. I feel so pathetic.

So that plus the loneliness of not being able to see my friends and not telling them because our relationship was kind of a secret turned into really bad first weeks of college. I was really sad and couldn't make any friends except for a girl who started talking to me.

I've had moderated depression for a couple years now, went to therapy for a couple of months last year but my mom couldn't pay for it anymore.

So I started college kinda bad but kept getting worse, I couldn't keep up with the work. I was happier because I made a friend, but just her. I really want to but all the time I think people are just nice and they like me but just not enough to want me around. 

The second week of March I was at my worse ~~yet~~. I needed to finish a paper so didn't attend to biology lab, couple of days later didn't do the work needed for chemistry lab, so I lost that practice too, next day, turned on an incomplete homework, even when I had all the answers. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

Right after that quarantine started and I came back home, now with online classes. But since then, I have started getting worse and worse, I do less work than I did before, I can't get up of the bed, I can't bring myself to do anything, can't sleep either. I just don't want anything but disappear, I'm not even sad, I just feel empty and lonely.

My mom i feel uses me as a bank. So i got my refund. She asked for 500, another 500 and more and more until I had absolutely nothing.. Then she needed 300 to turn the cable on and I sais ok but i needed it back. Even the the woman over the phone said it was sweet of me to give the mo ney but my mom had a problem of me asking for it back and had an attitude and basically threw the money at me. 

My dad just made the situation worse saying she doesnt appreciate you and stop letting them walk all over you. My dad then took my accessories off the key of the car my mom and me got and threw it on my bed. My mom basically took over the car.  Bc i was working bc of maternity leave my dad accused me of laying up on my mom but before then i always paid the insurance until i couldnt. 

Even when i was in college with every refund I had i always gave my mom 600 always. 

Back to the tax refund she wanted me to give my bro an extra 300 ( gave him 1k for letting me stay with him)i said no bc i dont have that much left and she started shouting and threatened to leave me at my brother's and take the car... 

Then both of my parents talked abt me loudly in my presence to friends or fsmily members..

Just recently my dad accused me of being a bad parent when i had my son laying on his back for half a sec and he cried while i went to get clothes to get dressed. 

Then said youre gonna be on welfare forever and the night before i saw a woman wearing a nice blouse anf my dad said I cant wear that bc I havr a stomach and the day before that said I still looked pregnant. 

My mom said she wish she left me at my brothers.. And i just dont know what im doing wrong except existing. 

Im not even looking fwd to my stimulus money.. My mom already factored in 500 from my stimulus but ofc shes gonna ask for more.

hate to say the typical 'dead inside' stuff...but man all i ever feel is usually anger, and depression...only have 2 family members that i talk  to(cant avoid it) and its always about how horrible things are EVERYDAY yet if i tell em its getting me down...i get treated like im a horrible person for saying so, the rest is work a job with people who arnt exactly decent people(trying to word that nicer than it really is im not even exaggerating) because its the only job that almost pays all the bills, cant get another one or better because of time conflicts with what i have to do to help my grandfather, and no friends to speak of...i thought i tried to make a few but it was always just...seemed wrong to try with them, they always turned out to be just unhealthy to be around or just wanted to do stupid things like sitting around talking crap about people, or go to bars and have no responsibility for their actions(drunk driving, acting degrading to themselves and to other people, ect) not very big into religion more out of a respectful thing because my family isnt exactly on good terms with stuff like that...i think my problem is just too much tv, comics, books, movies, ect because i tend to get jealous of the fictional stuff i see, more just ways that seem like things that are kinda based on reality, ya know seeing people happy, or even the crazy stuff like hero ideals...except im stuck doing everything i think is just generally pointless, i also tend to look at the state of the world and humanity and im very worried for the future of literally everything so im down because i cant do anything to make a pointfull change for that and i dont see anything or anyone else being able to do it either...its just a daily routine of work, think about how things are(100% of the time its not good thoughts) go home listen to the same things i was thinking about all day and more to add to it, finish what im told to do and just sit around distracting myself with games, comics, and movies because its the only way i dont hear my thoughts, yet i dont want to ingore them...it just feels wrong to ignore the bad stuff becuase its like thats what i think is the worlds just causing its problems from anyway...i dont even know what im looking for lol, i guess a bit of happiness/ways to change things not for myself for the planet in general(a bit stupid but my only bit of religous thoughts are that humans should be guardians of the planet and of its history and life so that we can repay the fact that were all really just lucky how things are set on this planet...it could be so much worse... if anyones even reading this thnx lol

...i have no adrenaline...no postivity to act on so really just trying things is a hardship in general, just caught up in fantasy ideas that make normal life extreamly boring while hating how the world and humanity is turning out..just pretty much a walking puppet with anger...hoping i can find a way work with my own depressing personality 

(btw i do appreciate all suggetions but ive looked into so much it seems like i cant find an answer....also i just cant beleive in taking pills or therapy(mostly on how little money i have on that therapy thing) and the area i live in doesnt provide really anything for the type of person i am...mostly for retirees, and just...bars i guess really nothing else not that i have the time or funds for anything else than what im doing right now...srry all 1st and only post ill make about depressing stuff...dont need to make things worse on other people ya know?",Depression

My life is pretty downhill, my first 10 years of my life were bliss but after that it was shit. I move a lot and could never form any deep connections until middle school I found my platonic soulmate she is so amazing and I love her sm we met in 7th grade but I had to move again after my 8th grade year, I used to cut pretty regularly in 7th and early 8th grade, but stopped after she helped me through it and I was so mentally happy.

Then I met someone, I was new to highschool and when I walked into my bio class I caught the eyes of a guy. Let's call him J he was also in my art class we gradually started talking, and I even started to feel happy after a long time. He then confessed to me, I felt so happy I felt so validated and loved..But we didn't last, I really thought we would last but no. It was so painful seeing him turn around and walk away. Like everyone in my life they all leave, no one lasts forever. Since then things got gradually worse and worse, I have two goals in life and it's to experience true happiness and love. But I don't think I will ever experience love, I don't believe in it. Love has only ever brought me bad experiences. But all I want is love, hugs and validation...

I am 29 yr old straight male.

About me:

I   have always exceptionally done well when it came to education,  hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme  INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters  here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working  well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling  that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really  appreciate any help. I  need some \_/\\\_.

Here's what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -

2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had

2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.

2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design

2015   - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence  kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to  make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started  smoking as  well regularly

2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.

This continued slowly until I graduated and moved

2017   - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, didn't work  out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would  stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started  living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they  were  toxic.

2018 - My sexual   frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just   liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do   anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess   it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated   because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I   felt stuck.

2019 -  Met a girl   through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all   wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of   surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at   them as well.

2020 Jan -  This   year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found   out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex   boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.

Feb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.

Mar   - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a   guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses and threatened to put all her cheating texts online.

1 week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf   in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it  I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,   where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And   none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.

I   made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started   working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex   even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of   such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started   apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I   tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona   outbreak.

Last week - she   contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She   did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told   me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow  I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her  life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able  to  move ahead.

I feel like I have  hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am  locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and  just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side  rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my  feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I  feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I don't feel  like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of  abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and  scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me  but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.

Thank you, and sorry for long post. \_/\\\_",Depression

These past few weeks in quarantine have helped me relax and not have to constantly worry about school, but I had no friends in school anyways so I have no body to talk to or play games with. I'm always so lonely, bored, empty and sad, but I don't want quarantine to end because then school will start again and then I'll start getting even more depressed and get panic attacks once again. Anxiety is already rampant when I'm trying to sleep (racing heart, chest pain, sleep apnea,) this all happens every single night when i'm trying to fall asleep.

I'm also always super self conscious because i've been told that i'm ugly and stupid by everybody i've ever know in my life. Now I have to always hide my face and can't even look at people in the eyes in case they look at my face. Doing any activity is also challenging because I lack any motivation. I keep missing multiple online assignments from school. I always keep judging myself for anything i do, there's always a voice at the back of my mind telling me that i'm worthless, ugly, stupid, talentless, that I should just kill my self and end the suffering, and I really want to.

All i would really want right now is someone to hug me and let me tell them about everything, my parents are mega religious so they always just pray for me, and since i'm atheist it does nothing to help me.",Depression

I'm trapped in my home with little to do other than course work and it leaves me often alone with my own mind. Trying to hide my struggles from people around me is getting old. I want to act happy and I want to act like every day is a good day, that whenever I talk to my S.O, I'm happy, when I'm with friends, I'm happy. 

I can't help it. I feel like such a burden. I feel like no matter what I do, I will always be the source of someone's anger or sadness. 

I feel it everyday. I feel myself slipping back into the hole I've been desperately trying to crawl out of and I don't know what to do. I feel a gaping hole in my chest and it all hurts. All of this is a pointless fucking ramble that I'll probably freak out about and delete again later. 

Why is depression so damn hard? I don't even know if I want to get better anymore. I know recovery isn't linear in any way shape or form, but the crashes are just too much. I rather stay this way than have hope again. Fuck, it all hurts so much and I'm suffocating.

My therapy is cancelled now thanks to covid when I feel like I need it more than ever.

I constantly try to be nice to everyone. My way of living is being nice to everyone no matter what until they give me some reason not to. Whenever I see any of my friends struggling, be it a tweet or a Snapchat story they've posted, a message in a discord server, whatever, I'm always the first person to be there telling them if they need to talk I'm there, and sending encouraging messages. When this covid situation started I could tell it was causing a lot of stress and unhappiness for some of my friends so I bought resources and spent 2 days making little care packages for my closest ones. I baked brownies, and made handwritten encouraging notes, and spent £30 posting them all. Doing good for others makes me feel happy, but I can't help but feel sad when even a fraction of that doesn't get extended back to me when I need it most.

My first boyfriend was extremely abusive, which has left me a bit traumatised since I did everything in my power to be good to him and was, imo, a good girlfriend. I spent half my wage flying from England to Ireland to see him every weekend / every other weekend when he never even came to see me like. When that ended my friends were very supportive, which was nice. I guess that's why I wish they were supportive more of the time, instead of it being such a rare thing. My sister and brother are 2 years younger than me and are in great relationships which I can't help but envy. I'm their older sister yet I'm a lonely unlovable failure. My best friend of 14 years died a couple months back and I still feel the impact, I kinda blame myself tbh, but even then when all my friends knew literally none of them except my other best friend extended so much as a ""hope you're okay"" until said best friend went off on them (we're all in a discord server together) pointing out that I'm always there for them. And right now, I'm going through a deep depression realising I care for everyone but very few people actually care about me, as once again none of those friends I am always there for have said anything, and I'm wishing I could just stop existing, because no one seems to want me to anyway. 

From growing up with kinda crazy parents, to being abused and raped by my first bf who was supposed to love me and now these friends who can't even put in a tiny bit of the effort I do.. I feel like I'm just here to make everyone else happy and to suffer in silence on my own because no one actually cares at all. I have hobbies and interests, I'm starting a diploma next week, I'm not totally hideous and I've been told I'm funny multiple times, idk wtf I'm doing wrong at all. I always message first and put the effort in like I'm supposed to. I'm starting to think I'm just fated to be alone forever.

Anyway this is really long and no one is even gonna read this anyway I just needed somewhere to get this out. If it weren't for my dog depending on me I'd probably be strongly considering just offing myself by this point. I'm so very tired of trying to convince myself it'll get better and my efforts are appreciated. They never fucking are. Thank you if you actually read this. I appreciate you.",Depression

i met this girl in sixth grade. well, more like I got a crush on her but I never got the guts to talk to her. after a semester I had to move to a different middle school in the same district so I thought I’d never see her again but for some reason I still held out hope. 

time passes and high school comes around. it’s 9th grade and I’m in English class, talking to acquaintances, when I see her. long story short I get her Snapchat and we become friends. hooray. after a few good months of being friends I confessed to her. we got into the talking stage and I was so happy... maybe too happy. me being a 14-year-old who barely knew how relationships worked I was far too clingy and after about 3 months she broke it up and started dating someone else. I felt awfully because it felt as if I had been cheated on but after some time I realized why she would have done that.. we stopped talking for a while. 

Sophomore year came around and after a good 5 months of self deprecating I was slightly confident that things would turn around. wouldn’t you know it, she’s in my Gov class. we didn’t talk right away, but it was so painful seeing her and then seeing them together. one day I get a text from a random number asking who i was. I return the question. it’s her. for some reason i was okay with being friends. honestly, i had those feelings for her and after not being able to take it anymore, I confessed to her. obviously she was in a relationship so nothing happened. but those were a good 3 months of friendship. 

after a few months of crying myself to sleep, summer finally comes around and I start working a bit on myself. talking to girls. junior year came around and I was feeling okay for the first time in a long time. until I walk into my algebra 2 class and she’s there. I go to my lunch and I see her. a few months later I get a Twitter dm. it was her. she wanted to see how I was. we talked for quite a bit and became friends again. I still had most of those feeling but accepted she was in a relationship so I tried to not pay them attention. anyways, after around 2 months her boyfriend finds out about us (he knew about our ‘history’) and told her to stop talking to me. so we did. about a month or two pass and we talk again. I can’t remember how, exactly. anyways, he finds out and breaks up with her. she blames me for it and we stop talking. a few days later she texts me saying how they got back together. she keeps on saying it’s ‘toxic’ but she wants to be with him. anyways, we stop talking for a good while. this was like November (I think) and she texted me on the holidays to wish me happy holidays. January comes and she says how they broke up. he had cheated on her. we talk for a few days and I realize I gotta act on my feelings so I do and I confess. after talking it out we realize we both want to make it work out so we do. we are on the talking stage again and it’s all good for a few weeks. until she tells me she’s been hanging out with him. I ask her to please stop because not only do I feel uncomfortable with that, but he has brought so much misery into my life. she refuses, so I end things. a couple of weeks pass and she texts me. saying how she apologizes and wants to make work things work out again. I told her I’d be okay with that as long as she’ll stop talking to him. she says no, which was a huge red flag that I ignore. for some reason, perhaps out of fear of being lonely again, I tell her as long as they don’t hang out or talk *constantly*. we go for a few weeks and it’s really great. until she tells me he was going to go pick her up. it was like 11pm. I told her to please not go but she said it was okay. after a night of feeling miserable I woke up and waited for her to be up. when she was, I asked her how it went. she told me they kissed. I ended things right there and then. 

Last week I was texted her at around midnight. I had received a text from her that apparently was delayed a few weeks so I asked what was going on. we talk about everything that has happened between and somehow we both still want it to work out. I tell her again that she can’t hang out w him if she wants to try again but she says she can’t because now he’s in her friend group. I ask her that then she just doesn’t talk to him and then she says she won’t do anything. that apparently I’m the person she wants. she tells me that maybe we shouldn’t start anything right away because she needs some time. I tell her I’m okay with waiting for her (I wasn’t). one day in the morning she texted me the image of a pregnancy test with a faint second line asking me if there was a second line. I immediately ask her if she had sex and she tells me she did ... this is during this whole quarantine thing so I haven’t seen her in weeks. she doesn’t tell me who it was but I’m pretty sure who it was. anyways, we stop talking. 

today I was going to walk my dog as I usually do when I see the two of them by my house (she knows where I live) and I almost broke down crying. why? why does this have to happen to me? I think I was talking to her out of fear of losing her and being lonely but i don’t know. I’m just usually so lonely. I’ve tried talking to other girls and things just never work out. I do have friends and my family situation is okay but this kind of stuff breaks me, especially because of my age and how much importance there is in these kinds of things. I don’t know what to do, honestly.",Depression

I'll be the first to admit that I don't know what it feels like so I did my best to empathize and point out that everything is going to be alright and that there is support in her friends, and of course all our love. The next day I went home and then was texting her throughout the day.  I told her how happy she makes me to be alive, and how great I felt because of the people that surround us. I told her that she was my family and that through the highs and lows there is always love. How fortunate and lucky I am considering the circumstances of the virus.  She took this horribly and said that I ruined her day and now has asked me to leave her alone.

My bf broke up with me during his depression.,1,g0w015,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0w015/my_bf_broke_up_with_me_during_his_depression/,4,1586855862.0,"My bf & I have been dating for several years now. Every year during the fall/winter months he becomes depressed. However, in the previous years it wasn’t that bad. He said that he’s had this since he was younger and he just recently opened up to me about it. Now looking back I can see a common trend to some of his actions.

Things in our relationship have progressed a lot over the last several months/year. We’ve both grown together and learned from each other. We’ve spoken bout marriage, kids & a future. 

Like every couple we do have our down moments. He’s a very fun & friendly guy. Due to some past experiences, including with him, I have trust issues & that leads to some discussions but we always overcome them. 

Overall, we are super fun loving, we vibe so well, we joke, we have the same social energy & it’s great. He’s not from here & we are both not from the same ethnic background so we do share some cultural differences but nothing serious.

I’m writing on this for the first time because I really am at a loss & am seeking some advice. Nearly a month ago, he broke up with me bc he said he was feeling disconnected with a lot of things, people & feelings. He can’t find a connection with anything & there’s a lot going on in his mind. He has become such an amazing person over the last several years & he always thanks me for the growth that he’s made & the love/support that I give him. He said that this break is solely about himself and working things out. He doesn’t know how long it will take & doesn’t want me to just sit around & wait for him while he’s trying to figure things out; he thinks that would be selfish of him to ask of me. I told him & tell him everyday that I am waiting for him, I’m supporting him, I love him & whenever he is ready to talk/open up, I am here to listen to it all. 

We still talk everyday & chill weekly-ish but he is trying to distance himself so he doesn’t call me terms of endearment or act fully normal with me. Some days I get insecure & think that maybe this is about him wanting other girls. He always reassures me that it’s not about that & that if it ever came to that, he would tell me but really all he’s looking for is to be alone & work on himself for right now.

I try to stop getting upset over my insecurities & pushing that onto him but it is hard. He is still so understanding & reassures me as much as he can while he is going through this. I feel bad bc I want to be there for him as much as possible & I want him to open up to me so he can heal. I’d love more than anything to be together with him again.

During this COVID-19 quarantine, I see he is struggling to keep his mental heath up. He says how he wants to play sports or see his friends or even just go to class so he can get out of the house a little. He’s more of a homebody but he does enjoy going a few places & being around people. I’ve suggested working out, reading a book, making a puzzle, painting, playing video games... literally everything & he does do some of them but he is struggling more now since it’s been a few weeks at home.

Any advice on what I can suggest for him, actions I should take on how to make things better or anything that will help (both his mental health & our relationship)?

Thanks in advance (: Stay safe!

Am I just being sensitive?,1,g0vxmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0vxmt/am_i_just_being_sensitive/,2,1586855605.0,"i'll try to make this short but this is something that's been bothering for a bit TLDR at the bottom 

Me and my sister both grew up with alcoholic parents, we went through the same trauma but my sister was always the more rebellious, bubbly and happy one. While I grew up with multiple suicide attempts, a bunch of scars from self harm and severe depression. 

I feel like I was just to sensitive to handle my parents fighting and I grew up depressed. I don't really remember much of my childhood so maybe I went through a lot worse than what I can remember but from what I know I feel like I was just being sensitive. I'm just so frustrated why did my sister grow up right and why did I turn out so wrong. 

She has so many friends, she's really sociable and outgoing, she's really affectionate towards my parents. While I stay to myself and get so damn uncomfortable when I have to open up to anyone especially my parents. 

Though we did move towns when I started middle school and me figuring out I was transgender and being stuck in the closet. Combined with the fact I was in a completely new school and lost all my old friends contributed a lot to my depression. While my sister hated the old town we lived in and for her moving was a fresh new start. I basically hit my lowest point in life. (But freshman year is when I was able to come out and transition and i've been so much happier and came out of my shell a lot more.)

I don't know i feel fucking pathetic, i don't deserve too have as many scars and suicide attempts. I mean people cope in different ways, my sister was a lot more emotional and rebellious than I was. I still feel like I was overreacting. Is there just something wrong with me? Am I just sensitive? I feel like I grew up wrong.

TLDR: Me and my sister grew up with alcoholic parents, we went through similar stuff. But while I grew up depressed and suicidal she grew up outgoing and positive. Was I just too sensitive to handle it? I feel like I grew up wrong.",Depression

Help,2,g0vuu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0vuu3/help/,4,1586855309.0,"Okay, I don't know where to start from this, but if there any spelling errors im sorry, because the tears are covering my eyelids. But I guess I should start with the fact that I'm not normally a suicidal person but the though has been crossing my mind whenever bad moments come and go since August (me moving in with my dad) and im also not just some edgy guy looking for attention, but I honestly don't know where else to go. I can't even tell if this is my way of coping, or if I think some magical solution will come from this. But im desperate. So one problem i've been having is with myself. It's not that i've everhaf trouble making friends but it's something else. I can't pinpoint it but I would make friends at school because imbalone. I have never actually walked up to someone to befriend them ive always just sat by myself and people came to me. Yet I was still a really outgoing person I just didn't how. Kind of pathetic for someone who has been to 7 different school because of moving huh? So I'm already a guy with not a lot of friends. But the main place I made friends was over online gaming. And ive met so many people that I know have changd me for the better. And i had thisnone really close friend named joey, I met him while playing rainbow 6 and we became good friends since. Bit then shorlynafter I moved here I was told by one of our other friends (who was close to his half brother) that he'd commitednsuicde. And that was the first big death ive ever had in my life. AND IT WAS ONLINE and in still thinking back to wether or bot I couldve done somthing to make it better because we were just having a blast on overwatch two nights begore. I know its bot my fault and that his family was mourning so much more. So i told everyone in our friend group to send his mother our condolences and it turned out okay.

Now indont know the character limit on reddit so im gonna keep thisbshprt. Im mainly just sad because I habe no form of control in my life right now. I move to minnesota with my dad with 4 other little brothers on is 11 and doesnt do any of his chpres and gets away with it he doesnt even feed his animals (beong two cats turtle and a lizard). Ones 9.amd has some learning problems, so he hets leniency, but that's fair. And the others who are 6 and 3 just run around messing up, stealing food from the kitchen, allowed to curse for some reason. And all of this haappens while they are under the watxh of my dad and step mom. So I the oldest at 16 have to clean the whole kitchen, that my step mom perpously messes up and allows my brothers to get away with eatimg in there. And the one that put me into this mess, cleaning the EMTIRE downstairs. So my dad and stepmom jave been sleeping down here for the past few nights with my little brothers (6&3) and they are supposed to go upstairs and sit in their bed by 8. But for some reason, they have been allowed to ait dpwn here with them and MESS UP THE PLACE. The parents are sitting there breaking their own rules by bringong all of these quilts and covers downstairs, Nd bringing tons of food and drinks. They also just let my little brother get all of these chips and drinks spilled all over the place. And then they just dont clean ot up... This has been happening for the past 3 nights now, and I began to get sick of it. Zince I'm cleaning up after MY OWN PARENTS, and no ome else is doimg any of their chores at all! My little brother (11) isnt cleaning his room or the upstairs bathroom, and my otger brother (9) ismt doing his room or the dinong room, amd getting away with it. And i get my xbox taken away because MY LITTLE BROTHERS WHO DONT EVEN LISTEN TO THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THEIR CHORES??? And since im supposed to be the ""big brother"" and clean up after everyones messes, and constantly tell these little rats to do what they are supposed to, and apparemtly act as the damn house maid 24/7. Just to get yelled at for doing a parents job... So later today, I tried to confront my dad softly, since the day befoew he asked me if everyrging was okay, and if I needed to talk about anything. And thatbtime i said no. But today i try and ask him ""dad, if you and my stepmom are here watching these kids, can you make sure they don't mess up""? And at first he said ""yeah"". Keep in mind that this same day, my stepmom said no games for anyone because she finally decided to do something aboutbthe kids not doing their chores, but it didnt make sense for me to be in trouble since i don't jave a SINGLE grade under 97, and my kitchen amd downstairs have been spotless (but my dad told me it was because I wasnt makomg the kids do their chores as i said above). And i guess she ran her mouth at my dad, because thats all he was saying when he started getting mad. So he literally just got mad because i politely asked him to not let the kids mess up.

So then, he decided to beat me...
I was just so shokes, and to thin kbaout it is starting to make me cry again because i cant believe that the one man i used ti look up to, just beay me over a situation so rediculous. And this was only the second time it happened. I remember about a month ago he was on the couch woth my step mom, and when i walked by he asked me about wheyger or not i had any friends. And of course i had some ao said yes, but I think some thoughts began to spill out of me because I didnt cry, but tears started to fall. And so my dad asked me why I was crying, and once I said no reason, he punched me to ground, and started throwing punhes at my ribs that later went into him slamming me onto the ground.. All because I was sad about my sacial life.
And of course theres a lot more to it, but im just so sad right now because there's nothing i can do, i cant talk about it because i would risk of making my dad or stepmom mad, i cant vent with any of my friends because im not allowed to, and i dont want to do nothing because I'd just go back to being a complete house maid. amd its not cleaning that's the problem, it's the punishments i get for not making the kids do their chores, or for not cleaning up after them roght. So I'm just lost as to what to do. Um just here contemplating running away, or flat out suicide. But I don't know what to do if I run away, simce I dont want to steal food and mess someone else's life up. So theres just suicide and the only thing stopping that is the fear of what could come since it either eternal nothingness, or if religion tirns out to be true, eternal damnation. But im afraid that once I'm pushed over that fear, there wouldnt be any going back...

Everyday I've been feeling down, and have felt a lack of motivation and a decrease in energy. I've been feeling huge amounts of guilt and remorse, and I've started to fear the passing of time, and change in general. I find my feelings really hard to explain, as theres quite a lot behind it. I want to see a professional about it, but I can't really because I'd have to tell my parents I want to go, and that wouldn't work out; my mum found out I was slitting my wrist, which I feel awful about because she claims she's worried about me and that makes me see myself as an awful person for causing grief to her, and she told me that whenever I feel down I have to talk to her. But first of all, I don't feel comfortable talking to her about most of the roots of my feelings, and second of all, whenever I do, she doesn't do anything about it, she just tells me to cheer up or something, and generally just doesn't understand how I feel. So basicallly, if I asked my mum to take me to a professional, she'd probably refuse to and tell me to tell her about my emotions. I'm not gonna ask my step dad because I hate him and he hates me. Moreover, I feel pretty crappy wanting to see a professional, as I know that most teens in the world probably feel the stuff I feel, and plus I don't even know if my feelings are a big deal. I might just be overreacting or attention seeking, I don't know. There are billions of people in the world, so my feelings don't have any worth, and there are millions of people who probably feel way worse. I don't think talking to an online person would help as they probably wouldn't be able to provide a diagnosis, and plus I feel that they would understand more if we were in a room together. Plus I emailed childline about my problems and they didn't really help.

What could I do? Is there a way I could see a professional by myself, without anyone knowing? I wanna debunk my insecurities, and I want someone to understand how I feel and explain things to me. 

Also, I know the pandemic at the minute makes it impossible, I'm talking about when it is over.",Depression

i haven’t slept in a day or so and i was gonna take a nap, but she said no bc we were gonna get on at six. six cake around and she didnt get on. i was pissed.

she then said at 8 that she never agreed to six and that she didn’t wanna answer my messages. she could have at least gave me a heads up so i could have slept or not felt like shit bc she was ignoring me

so at 8 i mention how she forgot ab me and she PISSED OFF and says how i’m lying and how she never said 6 when we fucking agreed to it’s making me all worked up and i wanna cry and fucking slice me open bc she always does this.

she always says that she’s right. She doesn’t know it’s so triggering to have to tell her that she’s right all the time even tho she’s not. i was right in this situation and she still made me say it was her so she wouldn’t get mad

she does it as a joke sometimes which is semi okay, but when she’s serious is makes me wanna fucking cry. When she’s in a bitch mood she’s in a bitch mood and i can’t even talk to her at that point bc i can’t deal with it.

and yeah, it’s triggering to be told your wrong all the time.

22/M depressed because of love,2,g0v9ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0v9ka/22m_depressed_because_of_love/,0,1586853148.0,"I think love is a cycle - and it happens every single time. I am still young, just a measly 22 years old. However, I feel like i have experienced much more than others when it comes to this...

It always begins the same.. infatuation, butterflies in the stomach, staring at your phone waiting for that message or call.

That is my favorite stage, without a doubt.

I get so involved in this stage, at times I wish I could just hit a pause button to have more time to appreciate the beginning of a relationship. In retrospect, I feel like I always move too fast, and that's where the problem arises.

Then you get to the relationship, and things are amazing. You begin to be together more, start declaring your feelings for the person as much as you can, the feelings of wanting to be with this person every minute of the day just keeps getting stronger.

Until something happens, usually something negative that happens to me, like a depressive effect or an instance of anxiety. And that is when the beginning of the end happens. When you show them that you're a human like everyone else, with real life problems.

And one day their tone is different, they don't sound the same as they used to, and slowly it progresses. Until you receive a text saying that its just not going to work out.

Its a cycle, a cycle that I'm tired of being a part of",Depression
I Feel Guilty and He's Stuck in My Head,3,g0v6u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0v6u6/i_feel_guilty_and_hes_stuck_in_my_head/,3,1586852873.0,"I was in a shitty relationship last year with someone  that was on and off with me a couple of years before. I don't know why I was even in a relationship with him again in the first place after all the different times he left me for someone else. I guess it's because people like him find insecure people like me and just plant themselves in our heads. 
I have worked at the same place for over three years and over time got to know a guy there. I never (tried) to think anything of him to begin with, but I think people knew I felt something for him anyways. I'm not very good at hiding my bashfulness. He seemed to be everything I wanted out of a person.
Things were not going well in the relationship I was in. I was duped yet again, he wasn't going to change. He said he got a coworker's number just to see if he still had game, quit the job I got him, constantly belittled me in his ""subtle"" ways. I was fully convinced I was going to commit to breaking up with him. I wanted to talk to the coworker so badly that night, and my alcoholism helped out with that. Called him, told him how I felt and that I was going to dump the ex the next morning. 
But I didn't. That's most definitely where the conversation began but he threw a tantrum and ""tried"" leaving without his stuff. In hindsight I see I was being manipulated but when I tried to calm him down and he started bawling about how he wanted to marry me, I felt horrible and like I was about to throw away everything for someone I've never been with. Who might just leave me high and dry after a hookup. I let my insecurities be fed and stayed with ex for a little konger. I told my coworker after work the next day.... he didn't seem upset, he gave me a hug and told me he understood. But then he seemed.... different. 
I broke up with ex for good after I found out something disgusting he said to my sister and how he stole another sister's ear pods. Hurting my sisters drew the line for me.
And I went to the coworker, he just wanted to stay friends and he would hang out with me and my friends for the next few months occassionally. A few months ago we were still texting sometimes and joking around. But, knowing I hurt him still haunts me. I've never done anything like that before and it was the shittiest thing I'd ever done to the person I didn't know I was going to hurt. I still cry about it and feel selfish for hoping he'll forgive me someday and want to try again. I try to escape thinking about him but I can't. I've got other shit going on in my life too but this feels like the biggest weight.",Depression

I say and post a lot of stupid things, and I'm no good at any of the games we play together, but they always welcome me. They're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. I think one guy, Rico, notices when I'm feeling off. He asks if I'm doing alright but I just give some vague answer. He's married with two young kids and I really don't want to drag him down into anything.

I'm one of the newer members of the server, and the guys who have been friends for awhile like to hang out with each other mostly. In addition, most of them are admins and moderators for the server. So, one day I was hanging out by myself in a voice channel when Rico pulls me into a hidden chat so I wouldn't be alone. One other guy, who isn't a mod, complained. He said I was cool, but not enough for the ""circle of trust"". Rico told him to screw off politely.

It's such a small thing, and I feel like I'm overreacting, but it really hurt. I always wondered why I would spend a couple of hours in chat by myself before logging off, then a few minutes later a full squad is in chat playing together. I'm probably being paranoid, but I feel like some of them are avoiding me. Rico says they aren't, but he's also the only one who will join me in a channel when I'm by myself, except for a couple of the newer guys. It feels like there's a clique of friends that the newbies aren't allowed into unless they're with a chaperon, and I hate it.

I want to leave and just let them forget about me, but I don't want to abandon the two or three that I consider to be friends. On the other hand, I don't want to be a burden on Rico that he feels like he has to babysit me all the time. What should I do?",Depression

So majority of the time even if it's for the tiniest of things I get shouted at and get called and idiot because I'm doing it wrong ' or that I'm annoying my parent has a tendency to swear or smoke around me which makes me feel insecure especially when I have two younger siblings living under the same roof and it most likely affects them to 

Furthermore sometimes when I get shouted it is really aggressive and contains some threats because of the cause of my depression not having my biological dad around so I never played catch he wasnt there when I learnt how to ride a back or see me start high school or primary (elementary and middle school for you Americans out there )

Moving on when ever I speak I have a large amount of sincerity behind my vocals where as when I get shouted at theres large amounts of aggression behind it also I have trouble speaking good grammar most of this post is actually automatically correct of completed by my phone:p so I have that running for me 

Heading back to the cause of my depression my biological father being the cause of it is always adding to my depression as it is as I recall I can message him when I'm ready and so when I dont reply I get shouted at which keeps adding to the pile of depression which makes me feel like trash and human filth and that I dont belong on this earth 

Being a 15 yr old white 2/3 english male and 1/3 danish (if I'm correct) makes it worse because my body has not finished growing same for my mind because your mind is actually the most fragile part of your body or conscious if u want to be scientific

A lot of it has to do with grades since my elementary school was rather easy and I never really faced any difficulty. 

I feel like I'm a massive disappointment to everyone especially my parents. My grades are really bad and they're declining more and more, and although my parents say it's okay, I feel like they don't really mean it and I let them down. In addition, I also feel like I also waste a lot of their time and money. I've picked up and lost interest in so many extracurriculars and sports over the years, and even though I want to say I do try my hardest when it comes to everything, I know deep down that I'm not doing enough and I'm just too lazy and lack motivation to work hard and accomplish my goals.

Online learning has been especially difficult on me since I made it my goal this semester to have all As. However, online learning barely improves my grades at all and I feel fucking terrible that I didn't do something about this before when I had the time to (like several years ago). I'd like to tell myself that it's alright, I'll learn from this experience and I'll try harder next year, but I know deep down that I'm just making excuses to cope with the truth.

As for my friends, most of them are nice but I don't feel comfortable venting to them like this since they'll judge me. They'll tell me things like ""it'll be okay!!"" though I feel it's not as sincere since it's much easier for them to say that when they're not going through the same. My teachers don't really care a lot even though they do try to act like it and often times I feel alone with nobody to turn to. I'd love to have a cat or dog but I can't due to my current living situation.

I started taking prozac and I was on it for about three year before I stopped because I thought I was much better and didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately, the decision to do that was around the same time I decided to start going out and drinking alcohol (8 months ago), which proved to be the worst decision of my life. 

I had a crush on one of my friends for 2 years. I've been called ugly by people, including close friends(jokingly, but it still hurts), never had a girlfriend and have overall been subconscious about my appearance during my 21 years of life. Because of all that I didn't have any confidence in myself. I kept my feelings for her to myself for a year and a half.  I finally decided to tell her how I feel and she said she wasn't looking for anything right now and she would rather remain friends. I was okay with that but I noticed that she became more distant and a couple times I got drunk and drunk texted my feelings -- things I should never say that ended up jeopardizing our friendship. Through that we remain friends until three months ago I drunk texted her again and as a result she blocked me on every social media platform with no explanation. The thought of losing her completely kicked in and I was trying to force a reconciliation by messaging her friends, just trying to explain myself and not lose her because I really did cherished her as a friend. I mentioned hurting myself and not wanting to live. Two days later, I saw her on campus (its a small university), and I tried to talk to her, but she ran away from me and called campus PD, which led to me getting baker acted. 

My crush had always told me how much she loves and cares about me as a friend, how we'd always be friends no matter and how great of a person I am. So never in a million years would I think we would stop being friends. People always tell me that I'm the nicest, most thoughtful and caring person they know, but everyday I wake up and feel like I'm the worst person in the world. It has really been eating me up on the inside. I lost a friend because of the mistakes I made. IVE NEVER LOST A FRIEND BEFORE THIS. The same week of the incident, a couple mutual friends came up to me regarding the messages, which triggered my anxiety to a whole new level. I felt betrayed that the private messages I sent while intoxicated were exposed and now god knows how many people know about them. I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped going out, deleted social media and have isolated myself and I don't plan on going back. My anxiety has skyrocketed and I just have been avoiding everyone. (all of this was months before the pandemic).

I know everything I did is inexcusable and I guess this is a way of punishing myself for it. The suicidal ideation remain. I am embarrassed. I am regretful. I am remorseful. Even if she forgives in the future, I   wouldn't want her to see me again. I just want everyone to forget I exist and disappear.",Depression

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, and for my dissertation I am investigating how instagram use affects mood.  Current research is conflicted as to the effects of social media, and oftentimes research is done cross-sectionally and not in the immediate sense.  I am hoping to change this with my research, and better understand the immediate link between using Instagram and mood across a range of participants.

I am currently recruiting research participants who are between the ages of 18-35, use Instagram at least once every other day, and can complete phone surveys on their smartphones multiple times a day.

If you are interested in participating, it would be a huge help to our team.  The study will take one week, will involve filling out surveys on your own smartphone, and you will be compensated up to **$70.00** in Amazon gift cards for participating in all portions of the study. There will be no direct benefit to participants.

If you are interested in participating, please click the link to this survey and complete it:

I really wanted to write this update because something really good happened, something that put some stuff into perspective for me: something I used to do in the past is causing me joy. I won't say what that activity is, because that doesn't matter. But everything I used to like brings me a feeling of sad, because I've changed as a person. I'm not vibrant anymore, but this thing... it makes me feel vibrant, and I think I see the sliver of hope returning. It's been so long since I've last felt hope.. for anything. 

I also wanted to add that for the first time in years, I let my guard down. I really feel like making more friends has given me more confidence and that maybe this could be the start of a positive life for me. Again, thank you to those who reached out and asked me what I was going through, I hope that this will bring some closure to those who have thought about what happened to me. I truly hope that this calmness sticks around for a long time and that I can spread it and make someone's  life better at some point.

I [M 21] have depression that started 1.5 months into my relationship with my girlfriend [F 18] and I fear I'm falling out of love.,3,g0sze7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0sze7/i_m_21_have_depression_that_started_15_months/,8,1586845132.0,"Sorry. This is a crosspost from RA but since no one responded in two hours I thought this might be a better place to ask... sorry!



Hello there,

Around the beginning of March, toward one of the nights, I was hanging out with my girlfriend and a friend, when suddenly a wall of anxiety hit me. (Do I love her? Should I break up with her??) Out of nowhere. I've never had a problem like this before. We talked about it, she said she wasn't really sure. She said she'd support me no matter what, I've started medication and started seeing a therapist. She's the most caring and kind person I've ever met, she's meeting my every need, and she's doing everything she can to make sure I know she loves me and she supports my journey. We are long distance unfortuntately, which isn't the end goal, but, important to mention, we want to meet and go on a date in August.

It feels like there's a part of me that's convinced I don't love her at all, and that I should break it off to save her the pain. But I don't want to, it's a sort of internal conflict. I legitimately cannot tell if I'm falling out of love or if I'm just dealing with depression and the remnants of being quickly and harshly dumped by my previous girlfriends. (Probably has something to do with it) I'm so desperate to stay with her and support her and yet it feels like every time we're just talking, and I have a thought like ""you don't love her"" it's all i can think about for the next couple hours. It's no doubt taking a toll on our relationship which is why I want to fix it so badly. I've never wanted to be fixed for anyone before. She is worth it. But I'm so terrified I'm in denial, sometimes we talk but I can't feel anything for her, then my anxiety kicks up to convince me I don't love her. It's terrifying. Everything triggers fear.

The reason I'm making this post is because last night I nearly had a breakdown at my own thought process. She asked me, as a thought exercise, if she thought ""the thought of her with someone else upsets me, or losing her upsets me"" and it didn't, in that moment. Which made me feel like complete and utter shit.

Then, today, we continued talking about what happened last night, trying to figure out happened, we played animal crossing, and it was nice. I felt comfy.

She asked me, a couple hours later, if I thought a break might help. I got scared, I felt terrified, scared, I didn't want to lose her, I wanted to cling to her and never let go.

I'm so scared and confused and I don't know what to do. My therapist has ignored me for 3 weeks after my first meeting with her and I haven't had anyone to bounce these thoughts off of except my poor girlfriend who is doing SO MUCH to help me through this.

Please let me know what you think.

TL;DR, I cannot tell if I love my girlfriend anymore and I'm terrified.",Depression

I hate social drinking because I fear of being taken advantage of, even if I'm tipsy I know I'm not fully cooperative, aka I prefer drinking alone in the dark. I wish my tipsiness pasted more than an hour, no matter how hard I drink... drinking makes me happier, and helps me spend my sleepless nights writing or being drunkenly positive, otherwise I would be a crying moron looking outside my window at the fluttering leaves. This is turning into a problem because no one drinks in the house and the liquor is disappearing....",Depression

Isolation Post Breakup - Brings Back Old Feelings of Hoplessness.,3,g0stdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0stdw/isolation_post_breakup_brings_back_old_feelings/,0,1586844578.0,"My own company is my worst company. Im sure a lot of people here are feeling the impact of this. I can't forget my problems by going to work, I have very few friends and none that I'm connected with in such a way that I can talk freely about my headspace, and living alone intensifies everything. 

For some background, I was diagnosed with pure O OCD, and PTSD from a number of things happening in a space of 12 months (nothing overly dramatic; a breakup, pet dying then mother dying). I regularly find my mind spinning back into old habits, intrusive thoughts batter me and I'm left empty, broken and full of loathing for myself.

I had a breakup a few weeks before the quarantine started, and I've picked this old mental scab until it bled. I've acutely self aware, I really wish I wasn't. My recent ex was very interested in personality types, and through her I learned that I fit quite well into the INTP bracket, which makes sense.

I'm rambling; I just feel so alone.",Depression
Why does she insist on fucking with me?,3,g0sro8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0sro8/why_does_she_insist_on_fucking_with_me/,0,1586844428.0,"My ex, who already ruined my head, continues to fuck with me. I can't wrap my head around what it wrong with her.

She broke up with me because she was cheating on me (for the 3rd time) but she ended it in January. Yes, I know why didn't I end it a long time ago? I'm a push over and let her walk all over me. Even now I still love her even though I know she has some mental problems. It's been 3 months. 

She lied that I broke into her house (while she accused me of many other things, that was the one that got her enough to get a pfa against me, and I never got to tell my side of the story in court. Also, the name of the house is still in both of ours, and I allowed her to have the house for her and my daughter) but either a stranger did it, or the more likely scenario is her or her new scumbag boyfriend(who I don't trust around my daughter at all) did it to try to get me out of their 
 life so I couldn't pick up my daughter by myself and not allow me to grab my things from the house.  

Also, shout out to that boyfriend who tried to make fun of me for living with my parents. Hey, you dumb fucker, i just gave you a house to live in, that's still in my name, and that slut you are living with is the reason I had to move back in with my parents 

Anywho, when the pandemic started she and him decided to plan a flight somewhere, knowing full well what is happening in the world. She did finally cancel it after she got laid off and had the stay at home order in place. But she was already willing to risk her health and possibly come back sick to our daughter, just to be with her new shitty boyfriend. Because she doesn't care about our daughter.

Then last Thursday, she said she can't keep our daughter for Friday(which was the plan). Because she has ""plans"". Things are fucking closed, you shouldn't have plans for anything. So I kept my daughter for over 4 days because of her negligence. We had a deal to split our daughters time 3.5 days a week. Which I'm fine with.

NOW, today I find out she suddenly wants to keep our daughter until Saturday. 6 fucking days. When I was supposed to get her this Thursday. Of course I can't do anything. I can't talk to her and ask her why. She can only talk to my mom. So something is fucky and I don't even get an explanation. My mom won't ask her because she's tired of being in the middle. But I deserve to see my daughter. I actually love her and give her all my attention. Suddenly this neglectful person wants to spend time with our daughter? Doubtful. She's been fucking with me for years. And she managed to make a pfa happen so I can't even check in to make sure things are ok, to make sure my daughter is safe. She's breaking all this social distancing stuff because she has no care in the world. Because she doesn't care about anything. 

I've had depression for years, but since January, this shit is out of control. She's pressing buttons that's shouldn't be pressed. And everyone believes her because she is the mom, the girl, and I have no say over anything. And I don't know how much more I can take. My brain feels broken. And I want her to feel like I do. She deserves being mentally broken.

Maybe this rant deserves to go elsewhere, I don't know. But I'm a fucking mess right now.",Depression

I’m at my last resort,3,g0snc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0snc6/im_at_my_last_resort/,6,1586844041.0,"To start I’m 16 years old living in Nigeria but I am from the United States and I am very American (Caucasian basic accent etc...) 

I feel out of place here and I struggle to hold onto friend groups because I don’t really relate to anyone. I’ve had experiences of being accused of rape and attempting suicide and a girl who I thought was the one breaking up with me for in her own words no fault of my own all last year. I think about ending my life daily but know it would hurt my mom and dad deeply and it’s the only reason I haven’t gone through with it.

I’ve talked to a therapist and have done counseling I don’t have family that I see often in America and don’t have people who care about me here and I’m getting to my breaking point, I don’t want to hurt my parents or sister but I don’t know what to do anymore

too paranoid to go outside,3,g0snao,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g0snao/too_paranoid_to_go_outside/,0,1586844036.0,"my grandparents are starting to force me to go outside, like take a walk. (yelling at me they'll drive me back home to my mom. technically my home is here tho) 

on another note, they promised me to drive me there at the start of may so i can see my cats again. i miss them a lot. (i hope that happens...) 

before today i havent been outside for a month. i just dont feel save going out.. not just bc of the virus, bc im paranoid and feel like something bad awaits me there. i wish the home office part of this pandemic would stay.. it feels so much better working from home. they constant weird looks of colleagues passing by is just unbearable, having to talk, having to work without creativity and fake smiles.

 my creativity is gone thanks to work. i dont even want to draw anymore. i used to be super into drawing but its gone now. i wasnt good at it, i suppose it was just to vent out my feelings. now that thats gone idek what to do anymore besides post here n hope for replies ig.",Depression

I feel better, I start making music on a free DAW I found. I post them on a twitter account and then tweet on my main about it, only to find out that no one fucking cares. No one.
The views I have are from my therapist and my cousin.

This is exactly the type of shit that makes me wonder if anyone cares at all. Friends say they care about you and then when the time comes, nothing. I don't get what was wrong that made them ignore the tweet.

I recently came to this point in my life where I no longer no how to handle things anymore... there are just so many things in my head dragging me down.

I once had a very good paying job but I left it because it destroyed me mentally only to be left with having to start over in a new branch and now all my friends around me are high paid workers with nice jobs and I have to work my ass off for a minimum wage.

I lost my old flat and had to go into debs to get a new one.

I have a wonderful boyfriend who tries his best to make me fell loved and supports me in so many way but sometimes I am afraid he’s gonna get bored or overwhelmed with me and will leave me.

I come from a big family with 8 siblings where I always felt like I was the least successful, the least beautiful and the least intelligent one. I always had this feeling to let my mom down, like I never did anything she could be proud of.

It’s just I feel like such a worthless human being.. like everyone around me is so amazing and beautiful and wonderful and I .. I am just the outsider.. the ugly one ..the untalented, dumb and worthless one.

The gay son who will never give my mom a grandchild, the childish guy who can never be a full grown adult, the dumb guy who never went for a higher education, the mediocre guy who hasn’t got any talent for anything, the one guy who got many friends but no true friend, the guy who just wants to be loved but is afraid he can’t give enough love to his boyfriend ... and at this moment this guy just needs someone to tell him that his worth living

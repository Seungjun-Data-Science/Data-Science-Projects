Is my mom drinking too much?,"Hello users of reddit, some years ago i started wondering whether my mom drinks too much or not. She drinks two bottles of wine by herself everyday (one at lunch and one at dinner) but what bothers me more is the fact that after drinking she starts to act different than she usually acts, for example: she says dumb shit (like she doesn't really think before speaking), she has some trouble walking and she goes right to sleep. I have been drunk before so that's why it kinda got me thinking that she might get a little dizzy but what bothers me is that she's like that everyday and even in public(which is really embarrazing). My dad and my sister don't think is that serious, so maybe I'm overthinking, but i wanted to see what other people have to say.",Non Depression

I just heard police sirens again at about 11 o’ clock this evening, while there are very very few locals on the road at this time of night.

My thought is that sirens were meant to allow traffic to know an emergency vehicle is coming down the road so that they could move out of the way. If there is no traffic in the middle of the night, why do people driving emergency vehicles turn the sirens on? 

I feel like I’m missing something here. I guess my simple question is why is the only thing that is breaking the silence here emergency vehicles sirens?",Non Depression

His logic was that if you're invited to a wedding you automatically get to bring a date. After that debacle, he told me he was bringing me to yet another wedding, and this time I asked him to confirm with the bride first about plus ones... And he chose to ask her at a large group dinner instead of privately. He put her on the spot and she had to tell him I wasn't invited to my face in front of everyone else, who was invited.

Season Pass Refund,"https://imgur.com/a/agAJ0oL?desktop=1

This company does a lot of shady stuff having worked for them as a teenager I try to stay far far away from here.

However millions of presale are tied up/spent in unknown ways and the company is refusing any refunds, ever. 

Feel free to call and workshop being a season pass holder; they are doing no documentation of calls and I would allege have no way of refunding the money they spent.

This is their latest tactic to block anyone asking about refunds or now argue with us they don’t have the resources.

These guys rent cattle to put in the employee lot to classify the land as agriculture; family has exotic pets as “zoo exhibits” on the park.

Heightened Sense of Reality at a young age ..,"Hello, I’m 15 going on 16 and here’s a problem that’s haunted me the entirety of my life at this point. 

Some background, I grew up in an old town in New York. My mother has raised me right and taught me right from wrong which translates how I treat people with respect to this day. I have one sister that has a mental disability that can’t care for herself and doesn’t have the development past 2 years old. My biological father left me at a young age but I know true to myself that didn’t have any effect on me. I have known my, now, stepdad since 2012-13 so about when I was 8-9. 

Around the age of 6, maybe 7, I noticed that I wouldn’t enjoy childhood activities like other kids would. I’d have negative thoughts of reality and the dark truth of the world didn’t seem to effect my friends. I’d always put it away and just act like they would but whenever family or friends would bring me somewhere, there’d always be someone there or something there that would make me feel bad. I was observant so that could stem out to present-day where I can find a motive for a good majority of what everyone does. I’d cry myself to sleep over these bad thoughts and I unknowingly taught myself the first few years to occupy myself to distract my isolated mind. Again, due to not having a sibling that I could necessarily interact with at my age, I’d have some time to myself. I got attention from my parents and received normal care. This time to myself would be nightmarish. Total isolation in my mind and I’d be stuck on things that had happened days, weeks, months ago and think; “why did this person act like this?” or “Why can’t I be happy like everyone else?”. Again, I’d counter this by occupying myself.

A few years pass and I move to California when I was a few months away from turning 10 and I still have this issues. Around this time, to me it was like “alright, these thoughts will go away when I’m older”. Nothing new for the next few years. When I got into 7th grade is when it was different, except I realized the thoughts were something everyone would have if they were idiotic enough to overthink things like myself. But now it was something different, I realized so many were so distanced from reality. Here I am, 10th grade spending half of it in quarantine having these godawful thoughts more and more with time to myself. I still feel now that people don’t have the same sense of reality as I do but I don’t speak of it to anyone because it feels as if it’s a curse. I am a sympathetic person and that would explain why I’d feel gloomy if I’d think about something bad happening. I feel so much more awake then everyone else, I know other people are intelligent but I don’t know what my issue is that I am more aware of everything around me. Everything including personality, ways people respond to events, etc. Any help or recommendation to another subreddit would be great. Thanks for your time.",Non Depression
How old are you and how many times have you been in love?,"I (F21) have been in love twice. First time I was 16, I knew I loved him when I first laid eyes on him. We became close later because of mutual friends, ended up messing around on and off for years. Eventually got caught up in the wrong crowd after high school and started doing meth and heroin, cheating and I found out later that he slept with someone I considered a friend at the time. Although we never “officially dated” (we would hangout everyday, sleep together, it was kinda known we were a thing) and he was a total dick , it kinda sucks knowing that was my first love. It started off so innocent and he let life turn him ugly. Seeing him turn into an addict and treat me so horribly changed me and the way I love. I haven’t dated for years since then until now. Which is my 2nd love, and he is wonderful and makes me the happiest I’ve been in a while. He gives me that movie kind of love, if we were in the 80’s he’d probably throw rocks on my window with a stereo kinda love. It’s just hard to love the way I once did. Now I feel like I have so many cages over my heart and it takes a lot more fear and effort to open up and love deeply again, but I’m really trying.",Non Depression
People with a DVD collection - do you ever look at your movies and rediscover old favorites or wonder why you liked some enough to buy?,"I have maybe 200 DVDs, (kind of small for a movie enthusiast I guess). Like most, I stream more than anything nowadays. But if I cant rent some old favorite off of Amazon, I go to my shelf and pop one in. It’s almost like using a vinyl record at this point.

I have favorites that have always been my faves, but some are also ones I rarely rewatch. Some I felt a strong connection to the movie when I bought it, and forget how good it is when I watch it every 5-7 years or so. And then some for special occasions or some that meant a lot to me as a teenager.

Do you have any you thought you loved but now cant get into the right mood to watch? Movies like Schindler’s List or Blood Diamond or documentaries that really moved you? You talk about them to others and recommend them, but havent even seen it again in 10-20 years?

How to find someone you met online,"Hello Redditors,
This is my first question here.
I met a girl on omegle, we instantly hit it off and exchanged snapchat ids. Both of us had anonymous ids on Snapchat, because you dont know what kind of people you meet online. 
Anyways, we spoke for a few days and were really in to each other. Then I got busy with work and didnt really get the time to answer her messages on Snapchat. Long story short, when I checked my snapchat a few days later, I found out that she'd deleted her anonymous account. Have been trying to find her since then. 
The info I have is her first name (i'm not sure if it's real or not), where she studied and the city she lives in since we discussed that. 
My mistake was that I didnt ask her for a real contact (which I wouldve gotten easily) since she asked for mine at the start but I told her it's too early to trust her.
I cant find her on any social media from her first name and the info I have.
Can anyone suggest any people searching services that are free or can anyone from related fields help me out please? 
For the second case, I would only share the info with someone who's a proffesional and genuinely intrested to help me out, I would be very grateful for your help and advice.",Non Depression

OWI/DUI first in Wisconsin. Please give me any advice you can.,"(I'm never drinking any amount and driving again and am extremely disappointed in myself.)

About a month ago I drove home truly thinking I was fine to drive until I saw lights behind me. I blew .094 and was charged with an OWI first. 

I had my initial hearing and pled not guilty per the advice of a lawyer consult. I let them know I felt one of the field sobriety tests should be disregarded since my shoe was broken, so I took it off and took the test barefoot and it also cold, so I was shaking badly. I took the breathalyzer at approx 3:30am          (.094) and the blood test was .091 (taken about 4:10am)

I have a call with the DA at the end of the month. Is there anything I can tell him or show him to possibly lessen the charges? or have my name taken off ccap? 

I'm looking at 6 months of a suspended license, required AODA class, an $810 fine, and obviously it being on my record. Someone who called me after the hearing said the owi will be public on ccap for LIFE. Is this true? (The case is on ccap currently. I have nothing else on my record)

I would continue to work with a lawyer but didn't secure one and with the current pandemic I don't have many options. I'll continue to try though. I've also been told that WI very rarely drops these charges....",Non Depression

Our rent is 500-600$ utilities not included, which is exactly our income, we spend about 50-100$ on food that lasts us a little while, and the rest on rent of course. So AC/heat and hot water are out of the question.

Profit hospitals need inspiration on why profits are not as important as staff safety.,"

9 RNs talked to the press tonight, frm Rmc &amp; MMC. 
We talked about needs for: PPE, communication re: exposure incidents, &amp; need to put exposed staff on precautionary paid quarantines.

WATCH;
We may be on: Fox 41 at 10pm, KCTV 5, KMBC, MSNBC/Chris Hays, NPR (radio &amp; web), KC Star web &amp; Sunday.

HCA got mad &amp; put out a testy statement in response. Here is our response to that. 
 
NNU’s Response to HCA Midwest Health:
 
It is disappointing that in the midst of an exploding global and national pandemic that HCA Midwest Health would choose to accuse its registered nurses of spreading “confusion, misinformation and fear” while they are putting their own health and safety on the front lines every day to protect HCA patients.
 
What has become reported throughout the world is that nurses and other health care workers are at disproportionate risk for the novel coronavirus infection, and spreading the infection to patients, their co-workers, and their own families. And what has become tragically reported is that nurses and other healthcare workers, have in disproportionate numbers, become sickened with COVID-19, become patients themselves relying on ventilators to breathe, and dying.
 
What the scientific evidence has demonstrated is that the “standard face masks”  HCA Midwest Health touts are not sufficient to protect nurses and other health care workers who have been exposed to suspected infected patients. Inadequate protection is the leading reason why so many health care workers have become infected, including in hospitals across the U.S.
 
Reliance on CDC guidelines, at a time when the CDC almost daily has continued to retreat on its guideline standards for health care workers and other safety measures, is a prescription for disaster. We have seen too many hospitals engage in a race to the bottom that will do nothing to slow, much less stop, the spread of the virus and mitigate this calamity.
 
It is important to note that CDC guidelines are merely recommendations, not a mandate. Hospitals that want to truly protect its caregivers and patients should be going above and beyond limited guidelines to assure maximum protection for the communities they serve.
 
We also reject the contention by HCA Midwest Health that the virus is spread solely by droplets. There is increasing evidence now of aerosol transmission of the virus which provides further reason for ensuring the maximum personal protective equipment in all hospitals, including those operated by HCA Midwest Health.
 
Finally, the argument that HCA Midwest Health cannot fully provide N95 respirators because it would “exceed the ability of suppliers to manufacture PPE” is specious. As the most profitable hospital system in the country, HCA has ample finances to acquire all the N95 respirators and other optimal protective equipment that its nurses and other healthcare workers need to protect themselves and their patients.
 
If HCA would like to see the increased national production of N95 respiratory masks, we invite HCA to join NNU in demanding that President Trump invoke his authority under the Defense Production Act to direct domestic manufactures to rapidly mass produce the millions of N95s, and even the more effective Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) this crisis demands.",Non Depression

I’ve recorded myself speaking on a few occasions since then and I DO pronounce certain words with an accent and I have no idea how or why. It sounds normal in my head (for example, teabag becomes tea “beg,” lamp becomes “leamp”)

In pole dancing they'll like dance next to the pole and lean on it and stuff. Roll around on the ground and stuff.

In gymnastics they do a lot of pointy foot posing while arching their back like a cat, and do some half hearted dancing.

In ice-skating, it's similar to gymnastics, but they try harder to dance good in between the spinning, and I think they do a good job. I don't begrudge the ice skaters as much because often the dancing is very good.

Usually when said friend has to go out of town he’ll hang out with me, which I try not to take offense to since I have a kid and I can’t day drink like they can. But, recently a different friend of ours has reached legal drinking age, and ever since then I can’t get him to hang out with me.

might be falling for a close friend,"using a throwaway for privacy. so a few months ago, i met a girl in class (university) and found her attractive. we talked for a couple days and i was planning on asking her out, but she caught on to my advances and told me she has a boyfriend (with some very vague indications she was not happy with him). so at this point i was like ok no problem, it was just a basic attraction so i can be friends with this girl. we both really enjoy being around each other and are basically the same person personality-wise (other than me having more confidence). weve gotten so close over the past few months very gradually at first but now we see each other at least 3 times a week. i make her laugh so hard she almost pees herself, and she comes over often to drink and just listen to music and talk (its been strictly platonic other than flirty shoulder punches and shit like that). i know the first thought is gonna be “if shes comfortable doing this to him then she’ll do it to you too” but clearly if she wasnt loyal she would have made a move by now or taken me up on my date in the first place. i get the feeling that shes into me, but the problem is shes very insecure and has opened up about it to me before. she is not at all happy in her current relationship which has been deteriorating even longer than i’ve known her. she is scared to leave him because she thinks no one will date her, legitimately, she has explained its not fishing for compliments either. her bf is a complete fuckup just from hearing her complaints about him, but he has her manipulated via guilt to stay in the relationship. he tells her “youre gonna have to break up with me because i love you more than you love me”.

so anyways i had been holding my tongue as i kept developing stronger feelings, and i am definitely no homewrecker. but as a very empathetic person hearing this got me to tell her that i would date her if she was single, because as someone who used to be very insecure she deserved to know that. she seemed really surprised at first and then smiled and said i’ll definitely keep that in mind. and this was earlier this week. she regularly talks about her bf in a negative way and is in a long distance relationship with him. as long as ive known her she has gone to see him twice and he has never bothered to come up and see her. as i mentioned before she is VERY shy so i dont think she would outright say she has feelings for me especially in a relationship, but i am confident there is definitely at least some interest. i’m not here to play the waiting game i just genuinely love spending time with her and have gained some mutual friends out of knowing her as well. that being said, i’m starting to fall for her pretty hard. this doesnt take away from the times we hangout and how much fun we have, but its been starting to be on my mind more recently. as of now, my feelings arent strong enough to justify cutting her out, but the hourglass has definitely started. not so much looking for advice as i am insight. what would you do in my situation?


TLDR: was attracted to a girl in an unfulfilling long distance relationship. thought i could keep it platonic but am starting to catch feelings. almost certain she is into me as well, but is very insecure about leaving her bf. told her i would date her recently to see if the dynamic changes in the coming weeks",Non Depression

tired of hurting people need ideas,"hey, so im 25 yr old guy and 6 months ago broke up from an on/off 7 year relationship and now im kind of together with a japanese girl for a month or so but the last week i am very annoyed by every move she makes and i lost all physical interest. So let me explain, she is sweet and smart and very intelligent but she does not make ANY effort to being a “sexy” woman or a woman at all. Like i dont want to sound arrogant but i like the simple things like cute underwear or even a bit of makeup because i have always been around “hot” girls or girls who make an effort being hot. And its the norm for me. When i started dating her i promised to myself that i wont go for “hot” looks anymore and rather go for the person but fuck now im in a point again where i lost my interest because of the reason above. Should i stop lying to myself and just say that im not interested and move on ? Like i dont want to brag but i am kind of an 9/10 tall very artsy musical guy with tattoos and good looking so i would rly have no problem finding girls but IM SO SICK of hurting girls because i lose physical interest in them so quickly.

Should I warn my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend about how he acts?,"First time post, and apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit. I recently found out from someone who knows my ex-boyfriend (who I dumped over a year ago after 9 months of dating) that he's dating a new girl. I normally wouldn't care, but during the time we were dating he was controlling, manipulative, a heavy drinker, a serial cheater, and emotionally, mentally and physically abusive to me (shoving, punching me in the face, yelling at me, calling my body disgusting, saying nobody loves me but him, etc). When I was dating him, the girl he dated before me reached out to me to warn me about him, but I didn't listen. All of the bad things he did to me, he had also done to her. She and I are now friends and I realized how thankful I was she tried to warn me.

Should I now reach out to this new girl and warn her? It's been over a year, I've moved on and have an amazing new boyfriend, and life is going great. I've blocked my ex on all socials so he won't know where I am and what I'm up to. I'm afraid if I warn this girl, that he'll find me and try to threaten my now-peaceful existence. Is it my duty as a woman to warn her? Or do I let her realize how awful he is on her own (shouldn'tbe hard due to his track record)? Thank you for your help.",Non Depression

How do I tell my flatmate they need to shower politely?,"My flatmate (34/m) and I (30/m) are going into our 3rd week of solid quarantine.

I moved in with him after the end of a 7 year relationship and this is my first time living with another person I'm not dating or related to.

I've always had issues with his personal hygiene. But I tried to just work with it and eventually even figured out creative solutions.

Prior to the Coronavirus, I had convinced him to join me at the swimming pool in order to help him with his weight. It worked great because I killed two birds with one stone. Had him losing weight and taking regular showers at the pool.

But then everything shut down and we've been placed on home office and under quarantine.

The last time we went to the pool was March 1st. He has not bathed, used deodorant, or brushed his teeth since then. As a result, he and our shared flat smell like the underwear of a homeless man.

When he uses the bathroom. He doesn't wash his hands. He does however, go to the sink and wets his hands (doesn't actually wash, the water is on for literally two seconds)

It wasn't until today that I realized he hasn't had a hand towel in the bathroom, or a body towel for a long time. In fact the only towel in the bathroom is mine.

So anyways I vomited from the realization I've practically been drying off after my showers with his feces.

How do you suggest I bring this up to another grown man?

Man, just keep ya mind open, that’s all I’m saying. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Each to their own though. U know?

Do u see them covered up &amp; preventing the spread of this so called ‘virus’?... Someone please tell me, how do they get to tell you what to do? But they don’t follow their own rules that they have set out????? 

istg, if this 5G shit wasn’t naked to the human eye, people would have a different view on this crazy outbreak of a ‘flu like’ symptom virus? 🤔 &amp; that’s when u go to the doctors, cos you wanna be safe &amp; protect your family &amp; make sure they’re ok. There’s nothing wrong with that, I get that, don’t get me wrong there! 

But okay, wait..

Let’s go back to last year: flu season! Hands up who went to go get a influenza shot &amp; still got sick? Stayed sick? Guess what? U probably got shot with someone else’s snot 🥴🤮 &amp; when you go doctors again to get tested because you have ‘flu like’ symptoms, you’re diagnosed with.... (🥁drumroll please) ‘CORONAVIRUS’  man, what perfect timing they have chosen? Season change when most people get sick 😳😷 &amp; then they inject you with the ‘antidote’ BOOM! That’s the magnetic cells (microchips) they inject you with, to affect &amp; control you! There’s a bigger field in Technology &amp; its already starting to take over! You’s have known this all along. As long as there’s 5G frequencies in the air &amp; you have been ‘cured’ you’re... (pardon my language) FUCKED! 🤭

Have you ever questioned why the lockdown is only at a restricted length of 4 weeks? Or is it 4 months? 👀🤷🏽‍♀️ I know when I get sick, it only takes about a couple days to a week to get better. Open your fullahs eyes bro! They’re installing more &amp; more 5G  towers &amp; little pinger towers, all around the motu! Honestly guys, just be aware of your surroundings. You’ll notice more towers once this lockdown shit is over with! &amp; you’re given the aye okay to come out &amp; play. 

Tell me? Is installing 5G towers classed as a essential work? Us being in lockdown is a blindfold, so you can’t see the bigger fkn picture of what’s really gonna poison us! Watch the skies at night, &amp; keep your ears open! 

Shit, even these cops are on the look out to make sure nobody out on the road watching, catching &amp; witnessing these robots planting the 5G towers in &amp; around your local area!

[Serious] Is my house being cased?,"I recently purchased a house (around two months ago) in a neighborhood that is somewhat known for having a high incidence of crime, and I’m a first time homebuyer.  I’ve previously lived in apartments and other places with other means of recycling and trash collection—you’ll see why this is relevant.  

Around 11 AM yesterday, my husband and I left and were away until around 8 PM.  When we got home, our recycling bin had been moved from its normal position along the side of the house out to the curb.  Funny thing is, though, that recycling collection is every other week, and this week is an off week.  No other recycling bins—nor trash bins for that matter—were placed out for pickup.  

My suspicion is the following:  a bad actor went to potentially try to look in windows (all of which have coverings), check if any windows or doors were open, and to see if/when we put the recycling bin back in its place.  

Some background info—husband is currently unemployed and we’re remodeling the bathroom.  As such, he doesn’t leave the house very often.  I work remotely, and due to current events, I’m also at home most of the time.

And this is to give you an idea of the layout of the property:  standing on the street looking toward the house, to the left is an alley and to the right is another house with a separation of around 10 feet.  Behind the house is a backyard, and a detached garage.  The backyard is fenced between the garage and the house, but the fence is lacking a gate.  The garbage and recycling bins are usually placed between my and my neighbor’s houses.  The house is set back approximately 30 feet from the street.  

What I’m wondering is if anyone has heard of burglars using this strategy to case houses, or if you potentially have an alternative explanation.  Also, any tips for residential security are more than welcome.",Non Depression

I don’t do any tricks or attempt to get in anybody’s way, I just cruise around for fun.....I guess that’s the purpose of a cruiser anyway.

In fact, I get a lot of compliments from strangers about my board, dog owners are nice too (and that’s because their pets get really excited whenever they hear a skateboard run by).  Probably because the city is generally more accepting towards different kinds of people including skaters.

Ideas of shared wealth VS a balanced system,"I have always had an issue with the stock program as it allows someone with no connection too the work force to make decisions that drastically effect them.

Why do we hear so much more talk of taking money from wealthy individuals that merely took advantage of the systems in place instead of fixing the system that allows so much of the profit of companies too be taken away from the workers? If the economy grows 10% every employee gets a 3% raise? If sales increase people still lose hours and pay to increase margin?

Is my ex best friend a sociopath? How could someone do all this without feeling remorse?,"   This is going to be super long because there is a lot of backstory and i tend to over-explain. But my god this girl ruined my freshman year of college and is the reason I dont trust people easily. It all started in high school. I had been friends with this girl since freshman year but we didn’t get super close until the end of our junior year. We would hang out almost everyday. She seemed so sweet to me at first, dropping everything to be by my side if I was having problems, checking up on me, she would bring me food/ Starbucks every so often, really nice things. I started to notice small things throughout our friendship that seemed off about her however, I kinda just brushed them off. So later down the road, we ended up getting into the same college and decided to room together (huuugee mistake). This is when I really started to notice she was not who I thought she was. 
     The start of college was great, we went out together, we rushed the same sorority, had the same friends, etc, but a few months into the semester she started to act different. There were a lot of times when I would ask her to go out to a party with me and she would say yes at first and then bail on me last minute (not a huge deal but kinda disappointing) so I would go out with other friends, but she started to get mad at me for coming home late, and by late I mean like any time past 11. She would like to go to bed super early (9-10pm) and despite me trying to be as quiet as possible when coming in (slowly opening the door, closing it as quietly as possible, grabbing my pajamas and stuff to get ready for bed in the bathroom down the hall so I wouldn’t make too much noise) she would still say I was too loud and I would wake her up every time I came in “late” at night. I would always apologize and tell her i was trying to be as quiet as I possibly could but in the back of my mind i knew she was kind of over reacting, people inevitably go out in college and I get that it is important to be respectful of your roommate but that goes two ways. She started to give off the vibe that she expected me to go to bed the same time she went to bed. She would shut off the lights at 9-10ish every night to go to bed and if I was just in bed on my laptop  doing homework or on my phone she would ask me to turn it off and go to sleep because the brightness from my devices was “distracting” and she couldn’t sleep. (Keep in mind I was on the bottom bunk and she was on the top bunk, how she could even see the light I don’t know) I would get so annoyed by this but just kinda let it slide because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt so I would throw my blanket over me so the brightness wouldn’t bother her. But seriously how could you just expect someone to abide by your 9pm bedtime? Seems a little ridiculous. I can remember a few instances where I would be at my friends dorm (which was across the street from mine) just hanging out or doing homework and if I was still there past 10-10:30 I would get a text from her asking me where I was and when I was going to be home. I would tell her “at ____’s  dorm, probably be home by 11-11:30” my roommate would then text me “can you come home like right now I am trying to go to bed and you always wake me up when you come in” and when I responded with something like “I am finishing a homework assignment up but I’ll come back once I’m done” to which she would proceed to text to the friend I was with to ask if she could “send me home because it was getting late and she wanted to sleep”. Who does that? She’s not my mother and cannot dictate what time I came home. There was another time where I went to my now boyfriends house (we had only been talking for less than a month at this point in time and weren’t dating yet though) to pick up alcohol for me and my friends who were visiting the next day (he was 21 so he would buy it for me). I was leaving my dorm room around 9pm to go walk to his house to pick up the bottle when my roommate asked me where i was going and what time I was going to be back, I told her what I was doing and that I would be back in about 30 mins ish, it was a 10-15 min walk. She said okay and I went on my way. When I was about halfway there I got a text from my boyfriend saying, “hey were you planning on staying the night?” I said I wasn’t planning on it but I could if he wanted me to, to which he said he was just wondering because my roommate texted one of his roommates that she knew to ask if he could ask my boyfriend to have me spend the night there so she could go to bed.    She had done this completely behind my back. When I had gotten to the house, I got a text from her saying “can you please spend the night there for my own sanity” i didn’t even know how to respond to this because first off, that is not my decision, second of all I felt unwelcome in my own room. This put me in a super uncomfortable situation especially because I had just started talking to this guy and he also had to wake up for work early the next morning. He was very nice about it and ended up telling me to just spend the night because he didn’t want me to have to deal with her but I still felt really bad and that I was being a nuisance. I again, was extremely annoyed by this but I brushed it off because I am a nice person and try to avoid conflict as much as possible. 
    The next day, a few of our high school friends came to visit us for the weekend and were staying in our dorm. Since the dorm was small, there weren’t many places for people to sleep so we had to squish people in. It was pretty late at night when everyone had arrived and when I was talking about where people were going to sleep, she had sprung it on me that she told a few of the people that were coming (these were close friends of hers, I wasnt very good friends with them) that they could sleep in my bed. I asked her why she would tell them that since I obviously planned on sleeping in MY bed and she told me that I she thought I could go to my boyfriends to sleep so everyone would fit. Then got mad at me when I said I wasn’t going to ask to sleep there since that is not my place to ask. Like what? 
   At the beginning of first semester, my roommate and i had agreed that we would switch bunks halfway through the school year since we both wanted bottom bunk to make it fair. So not even halfway through the first semester my roommate told me that she was super uncomfortable on the top bunk because it was too hot and she had issues sleeping up there and asked if I would switch with her. Normally this wouldn’t be a huge problem for me but since this happened after all the other stuff I had described earlier I was pretty fed up and reminded her that we agreed to switch halfway through the year. After she begged me, I gave in and agreed to switch bunks with her. I would like to add that I was a very good roommate to her, i would do anything to keep her happy since I am a people pleaser. I would keep the room clean, I would bring her home Starbucks if she was having a bad day, I cleaned her side of the room and made her bed a few times to surprise her, stuff like that, but nothing was ever good enough. 
     A few weeks after reluctantly switching bunks with her, I started to notice she was acting stranger than usual, for instance, she would be on the phone with her mom when I would come in after class or something and would get awkward and quickly end the phone conversation. I later found out that she was actually talking to her parents about moving into a single dorm and hid it from me until literally two days before she planned on moving out. I was so upset and felt like everything was my fault even though I tried my hardest to make our rooming situation work. I was also worried about the fact that I would probably have to have a new roommate move in, which would have most likely be this girl down the hall who was about to get kicked out of her previous room because of what a nightmare she was. I expressed to my roommate that I didn’t want this to happen and that I wished she had told me earlier so I could figure the situation out. She had told me however that she was talking to this other girl she was friends with that lived in our building and said that girl needed to move into another room since her current roommate was planning on moving into her sorority house second semester. I knew the girl she was talking to, she was super cool and nice so I would have been perfectly fine with rooming with her. 
    I was under the impression that this girl was going to move into my room since my roommate assured me that she had everything set up. Come to find out, the girl my roommate was talking about had already told her that she made plans to live with another one of her friends, information i later found out my roommate knew all along but decided to not to tell me and instead lie about it to make the situation seem better. So since those plans fell through, and since my roommate moved out at a weird point in the year, I was given one of two options. Either have the psycho girl who was in the process of getting kicked out of her room move into mine or buy out the other half of the room. After talking to my dad about the whole situation he said living with psycho girl was out of the question since he didn’t want me to be miserable and that he saw no other choice but to just buy out the second half of the room. Of course my parents were not happy about this by any means but they wanted to make sure I was comfortable in my own room, which I am super grateful for.. 
    A girl who I thought was my best friend seemed to not care at all how this affected me. At first having a room to myself was nice, but that feeling quickly faded and just turned into me feeling incredibly lonely. I never had issues with anxiety up until this point, i started to question whether any of the friends I had made at that point even liked me and began to distance myself from others. Eventually it got to the point where the thought of leaving my room made me anxious. Regardless of all she had put me through to this point and how much she hurt me I still remained friends with her because she was in the same sorority that i was in and was friends with the same people I was friends with. Staying friends with her, I thought, was just easier since I didn’t want to cause any drama. 

     So toward the end of Second semester, after she had been moved out for awhile my now ex roommate texted me telling me that her siblings (her sister (21) and her brother (24)) were coming to visit and asked if they could sleep in my room so they didn’t have to get a hotel and since she didn’t have enough room in her single dorm. I was confused why she even asked me this for aforesaid reasons and also because her brother worked on Wall Street and was making 6 figures, so why getting a hotel wasn’t an option I don’t know. I said no, first of all I was not comfortable with her 24 year old brother whom I had only met twice sleeping in my room and second of all it was on a Thursday night and I had an exam the next morning at 9am. I told her something like “oh I’m sorry but I have to say no since I have an exam the next day and I don’t wanna have to stay up late to let them into the building once you guys get back from going out” to which she had the AUDACITY to respond with “please, they would only be going there to sleep”. Excuse me? You expect me to house your siblings in MY dorm which you chose to move out of and stay up late to let them in when I have an exam  the next day? When you would get mad at me for disrupting your sleep when I would come home late? I was so fed up at this point. I told her no I’m sorry again and she replied “k I’m sorry I even asked” I really started to believe there was something wrong with her at this point that she got mad at me for saying no. I started to distance myself from her at this point but again, still remained friends with her.  

Flash forward to sophomore year, we were both moving into our sorority house. I was in a different room than her (thank god). To make things less confusing from this point on im going to give names to the people involved. So my ex roommate and ex best friend let’s call her Brittnay and I were both really close to this girl in my house, let’s call her Abby. We all hung out all the time and even though I still had issues with Brittnay I shoved them aside since I thought if I said anything it might affect my friendship with Abby. I also became super close to the girls I was rooming with, one of them, let’s call her Jessica, was not friends with Brittnay so I eventually told her everything that went down with Brittnay because I had never really talked about it with anyone and needed to get it off my chest. She was shocked but gave me some great advice and made me feel so much better(she is still one of my best friends to this day) I asked her not to say anything because I didn’t want to be known as the girl that talked shit in the house, and she kept it a secret. 
   So fast forward to second semester, in my sorority house we changed rooms at this point, and I was rooming with another one of my good friends while Brittnay and Abby planned on rooming together. Turns out, I heard a rumor that Brittnay had also told another girl, Megan that she would room with her. I didn’t know if this was true or not but considering all the shit that Brittnay put me though the year before, i wouldn’t have been surprised. I planned on telling Abby but wanted to get all the facts  and make sure it was true before I did. So it came time to preference roommates and somehow, Brittnay, Abby and Megan all ended up in a triple room even though Abby and Megan both were able to get a double room (we went based on a point system so they had enough points for a double room). So a little background, in a triple, one person doesn’t get a bed and has to sleep in the open air which is not the most desirable situation. So Megan ended up getting thrown under the bus having to sleep in the open airs. This is when everything came together. So Brittnay had been double teaming Megan and Abby, giving them the impression that she was rooming with them in a double then when they both preffed her, and she only preffed one of them as a roommate they would end up in a triple and since she had a little bit more points then Megan, she would end up getting a bed in the room, throwing Megan in the open airs. She also at one point apparently texted the girl in charge of keeping track of points and asked her how many points she would need to get ahead of Megan and Abby, so she had this plan in the works and didn’t even care that she would be throwing two of her best friends in the house under the bus. For me, this was the last straw and the point I decided I would never be friends with Brittnay again. You can do what you want to me but if it involves my friends I show no mercy. I told Megan and Abby everything Brittnay had done to me in the past and how I was super upset that she could do this again to people she was close with. 
    So before this Megan and Abby were not that close so they never figured out what was going on but they got together and decided to confront her for being shady. They each texted Brittnay separately (she didn’t know they were together) and asked her what was going on. Brittnay responded to them saying she had no idea why they were in a triple. Megan had expressed that she was upset and knew that was bullshit and that she was scheming. Abby had also texted brittnay saying that her and Megan were upset to which Brittnay had responded to Abby saying that Megan was just upset because she didn’t like Abby very much. Megan never said this and it was just a plot to turn Megan and Abby against each other to make her seem less like the bad guy in this situation. 
    So Brittnay ended up dropping our sorority and moving into an apartment since everyone in the house hated her at this point and so she could avoid confrontation. She still will deny that she did anything wrong and refuses to apologize about anything. 
   Also, side note I also later found out after all this stuff went down, that in high school, while we were “best friends” Brittnay hooked up with this guy I had dated right after we ended things. I had confided in her, cried to her over him and she did this knowing how heartbroken I was. I also found out she spread rumors about me and told people things that I told her in secrecy. Personal things. 
    So Luckily I have some of the best friends in the world now who would do anything for me, and I am a much stronger person now, but this girl put me through hell. I have always wondered what was wrong with her? Is she a narcissist? A sociopath? I don’t know but I know she has no empathy for others and doesn’t care who she has to put down to get herself on top. She also believes everyone still likes her despite all that happened. I just don’t understand this one and how she could be so manipulative.",Non Depression

Cousin sent a topless video to me (by accident?) How do I respond? Should I even acknowledge it?,"Not much more to say aside from the title...Late last night (like an hour ago) I received a text from a cousin who I maybe talk to a few times a year.  It was a video message of her in what I assume is a shower (camera moves around quite a bit but stays above her navel) with her breasts exposed.  

The video is maybe 15 or so seconds long and includes her face momentarily.  A second text of just a period ""."" directly followed the first text but no other message has been sent.

I'm at a loss on how to respond, or even if I should respond.  I don't know if it was an accident (I assume it was) and if so if I should make a joke or just...I really have no idea.  I've known her since she was a baby pretty much (shes a few years younger than me) so this is just about the weirdest thing all around for me.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Do I just ignore it?  Wait to see if she acknowledges it first?  Do I warn her in case it is someone doing something malicious?  Plz help.

"Quoted at $14,000 dental work AFTER INSURANCE","Okay. Long story short. With dental insurance, if you have not kept up with routine teeth maintenance, it gets really complicated and insurance does not cover a lot.

We went to a dentist and they quoted us $14,000 out of pocket after the insurance had covered $8,000. Let’s be clear, he needs ALOT ALOT of work done on his mouth.

I am at a loss because he’s in so much pain all the time. He needs some serious help, but we do not have the financial means to get it done. (University clinics are still too expensive/he needs too much work done for it to be helpful anyways)

Both my parents have pre-existing conditions and I get so worried that they might catch it that I actually can’t sleep at night.

[Serious] What is wrong with stock buybacks?,"There has been some negative press lately about how airlines have used their free cash flow, driven by recent tax cuts, to buy back stock.

A major purpose of joint-stock companies (an old-timey way of saying ""corporations"") is to maximize shareholder value.  Corporations normally do this in the form of dividends, but buybacks also pay back investors in the form of higher per-share prices.

There is actually a rule, that can be enforced by suit from shareholders, that a corporation is holding back too much of its retained earnings.  There is also a tax rule, rarely enforced, that too much liquid cash can be taxed at a higher punitive rate than the usual corporate tax rate.

I understand that the TCJA's cut on corporate taxation was marketed as a way to increase workers' pay (which was mostly a lie), but:  Isn't every director on every BoD legally if not morally obligated to find a way to pass the reduced taxation, and therefore increased after-tax profit, on to their investors?  Dividends are the usual mode of returning value to investors, but stock buybacks accomplish a similar result.

I feel like the current vilification of airlines is basically blaming them for not having huge surpluses of cash, that in a different timeline would subject them to excess accumulation tax penalties.

Unless I am wrong, buybacks and dividends serve exactly the same purpose and should be treated equally.",Non Depression

Help: Need to disinfect (non-pandemic related),"So this couldn't have happened at a worse time.

Sewer backed up in my basement over the weekend. Had 2 feet of standing sewage (read: human feces from other units in apartment building) and now I need to clean it up cause landlord sucks.

Thankfully I have a respirator from painting so I don't have to breathe in all the hazmat particles. Normally I would just get a bunch of Lysol wipes and disinfect storage containers and other bulk items I'm not throwing away/claiming on renters insurance.

However, due to the time we live in, I can't find anything like that from the stores, so this is where you come in Reddit!

I will be cleaning off metal, wood, plastic, and concrete (by hand and mopping), what can I use for disinfectant? I don't want to use just soap and water due to the level of bacteria that is present.

My cat also loves the basement and we keep the litter box down therezl, so that's another reason to do a really good job disinfecting. Cat has moved in to our kitchen until I fix it, so don't worry about whiskers.

Closed Eye Visuals as a kid,"So hopefully this makes sense, but i tripped for the first time a few weeks ago and when I closed my eyes, I experienced closed eye visuals, a common effect of psychedelics.

I’d do it before falling asleep, when I was bored, in the car, if my parents were fighting.... I’d close my eyes and think to myself “I’m gonna close my eyes and go to the movies.”  Like the visuals were that clear where it was almost like watching a cartoon show. I’d say this went on until I was in about 4th or 5th grade, I can’t really remember when I stopped doing that, but i haven’t been able to get those visuals since I was really little.

I sent him a very straight forward text about why i never wanted to speak to him again, and he never seemed to understand and tried to flip it on me, and we didn’t speak for about a year. 


Until a couple weeks ago, he all of the sudden kept replying to my Snapchat stories as if nothing had happened?? The first time i was tempted to respond, but didn’t. Then he messaged again, and again, and i finally responded with something lighthearted and i was nice?? like wtf?? i keep responding to this asshole as if nothing happened! Then, he sent a long “apology” if you could even call it that. He essentially said “it wasn’t my intention to take advantage of you i guess it just happened sorry”. Bruh. Thankfully i never said “it’s ok” or “i forgive you” i told him the cold hard truth, that i cried every night for a long time and couldn’t sleep because of him. He told me that he wanted to be “friends” again and that he’d wait for when i was ready. I WILL NEVER BE READY! i didn’t respond to that text, and he took that as me BEING READY 



He now continues to message me and you know what i do? Reply. 

I don’t understand why i’m doing this, because it’s almost calming talking to him, but then i also feel like vomiting. Whats also disgusting is that he is trying to flirt with me, how the hell is that ok?

Wrongful termination?,"Early last week, my (now former) boss told me he was writing me up for attendance issues. My grandfather had a stroke a little over a month ago and then passed a week later, I took about a week and a half off to help my grandmother. He repeatedly gave me grief about it and brought it up when I would ask for a day off or if I needed to leave early. Well, I never saw that write-up. He got onto me last friday about asking to leave 30 minutes early, literally chewing and cussing me out. He mentioned the write-up and how it says I'm on probation. I told him I haven't seen or signed that write-up. He said it doesn't matter, that's what it says. I was off monday, to spend time with my friend from out of state. I went to work tuesday morning feeling pretty rough. I had a sore throat and a nasty headache. Once things started rolling at work, I started coughing. A lot. My supervisor told me they had sent someone home the day before because he was coughing. A short time later, my operations manager sent me home, saying I couldn't come back without a clean bill of health. He told me not to clock out or touch anything and just go. I left and went straight to the doctor's office. They said I had strepp throat and she was keeping me out of work until monday. I got a doctors note and delivered it to the office manager. She said that was fine, see ya monday. I picked up my meds and went home. Then the plant manager (boss that ""wrote me up""), called me and immediately began chewing me out for having to miss work. Said it was unprofessional and that if I was sick I should have gone to the doctor on my day off. I told him i didnt feel sick on my day off and I'm pretty sure it was work that was making me cough so much. It was an industrial job. Lots of steel dust, acid/zinc fumes, and tons of other crap floating around the air. I tried to defend myself, but he wouldn't let me. He then told me this was just another attendance issue and that he was tired of it, so he was letting me go. I tried to tell him he cant do that, he told me it wasnt up for discussion. I told him fine, but I want corporate's contact info, and he just hung up on me. Now nobody will answer me. Can he really fire me for that? I had a doctor's note and everything. What with the pandemic, I highly doubt I will be able to get a job anytime soon. I have a family to provide for and I pay all the bills. My mom and my wife said I should get a lawyer and sue for wrongful termination. I dont know what to do. If anyone can help, I am all ears. I've also got this posted in r/legaladvice.

Help building playable PC set up?,"COMPLETELY new to anything pc gaming related ....So I have (idr the exact names and theyre at my fathers house rn) I believe a gtx 2sum bnib and if I’m not mistaken or at least from I was told a “Sum 1080ti” which is the one jus under the “gtx 2sum” which is supposes to be one of the best graphics cards currently available no? (The gtx 2sum that is lol)
  
  Now, lets roll with these fx cards are what I’ve been told they are ....if I was to buy the Dell g5 5590, or the 5587

 **which one should I buy/why or why not that one?** 

**what trim lvl would be best to run max “Hz” for 280fps** 

**If not that Dell set up what else within reasonable entry price? OPEN TO ALL SUGGESTIONS**

**Define “Hz” lol**

**Plz breakdown how this all works in layman’s terms, if anyone can simplify the process and lmk how, what, does who, where? that would honestly help the most** 

**Can I put the gtx into either the 9-0 or 8-7? like is it more or less plug n play? Also would either laptop be able to run its ‘full potential’ I guess so to speak? Tying back into trim lvls on the hardware itself I guess?** 

**Does the screen on the laptop have to be able to support a high “Hz refresh rate” for me to port the laptop itself to a monitor that can/does?” Or can I jus play it off the monitor no worries??** 

Im one for knowledge so if anyone wants to geek out with me u guys got my attention ....Being the kind person I am although I acquired this set up for only $500 cash (I’m a capitalist) it was a whole pc, it had the dope colored water cool thingy, was completely hand built dude jus took the motherboard or w.e held his personal info (I have ....No idea) I gave the pc itself to my Pops, wife’s kid, he wants to be a graphic designer or w.e, this was a couple few months ago and he moved out within the last 90 days I went to baby sit and low and behold there the fx cards are the one still in box ....and the kid I got it from used to play a heli sim so I have the gear from that (no idea what to do it?? with supposedly identical to actual heli controls I personally doubt it lol) 

**My base idea** 

Want to jus get a laptop that can attach/run the better graphics card and/or frames with no issues (only goin to be playing MW on it for now) I want that crispness I’ve only ever seen in random clips online lol 
And as long as the laptop (gpu/cpu?) is runnin smooth jus get myself a nice lil 32” monitor n be a crispy kid. I jus wanna be a Krispy Kid!!!

Soo I was like ok y not its a nice thing to do (ik im dumb but anyway) i leave after getting brainwashed and told all these nice things and my friend takes the car. I later find out she gave it to her boyfriend and its not even for her wtf right. I never meet the dude so im like sketched out after learning he has been driving drunk and high in my car without a license so i think hell no i need to take this car away from them but they refuse to give me the car because they paid for the down payment and demand it back. But I don’t work and have no money so i get a job to be able to get my car back. Once I started working i did everything I could to get them to give me the car back because at this point i also find out they both lost their jobs. So im left with their debt. I then gained the courage to go to the boyfriends house to take my car back and when i get home I notice the car is extremely keyed. But there are so many legal issues involved.

My father is turning 58 this year and he is has a very real fear of growing old. (Long),"1 1/2 years ago he had a mental breakdown due to stress from from his business and a emotionally plateauing marriage. He then went into depression and is still coming out of it. 

Yesterday we had a health scare thinking that he might have caught the covid-19, turns he got dengue fever. He got paranoid when we asked about the tests he did and when we tried to reconfirm the information he told us. After that I talked to him and explained that we were being concerned. And then he told me that we’re treating him as if he’s an old and useless man that can’t be trusted with what he says. I explained that that’s definitely not what we think or feel.

My father has always been a strong man, running a pretty big business and supporting the whole extended family. And now that he’s feeling doubtful and faithless in himself, I have no idea how to deal with this or how to help him. I’m a realist, and have a stoic outlook in life. I’m straightforward and rather socially inapt, it’s difficult for me to show emotions of caring but it doesn’t mean I’m emotionless or heartless. How do I help my father?",Non Depression

when should i worry about the nightmares im having?,"BACKGROUND :
i have been afraid of the dark for pretty much my whole life...but when i was in high school i started choosing darkness when i would sleep and would just keep a small nightlight on throughout the night. when i met my boyfriend i shared this fear with him when he asked what my biggest fear was. 
i said to go blind because i was that scared of the dark. 
we have been together for a long time now and because we live an hour away from each other i normally spend the week at home and weekends at his place. everything was good..we had that going for a while and still do it.  my fear with the dark never got in the way while sleeping over bc we tend to fall asleep cuddling. i recently came to visit for springbreak which began on the 9th of march (for breaks from school i spend all of it with him so i came to stay for the week) but that sunday i remember tossing and turning at 2 maybe 3 am not being able to sleep. i felt uneasy so i got up to turn on the closet light on  and opened the door. i got on my phone for about an hour and i remember i randomly pit it down and stares at the door and broke down crying in fear. the fact that i didnt know why i was reacting like this scared me even more. my boyfriend woke up and turned the lights on and switched sides with me so i wouldnt be facing the door..the next morning he told me i had fell asleep in seconds after the lights were on.
from then on i slept on the side away from the door and again..i returned to normal.

NOW:
our springbreak got extended 2 more weeks so im still at my bf’s house.. i have been having terrible dreams alll week long. i havent gotten good sleep and i stay up all night just tp get my sleep during the day with lights on WITH THE HOPE OF MAKING IT BETTER. the nightmares are very gory and i remember every detail when i wake up and through out the day. i even wait till the end of the day to tell my bf about them. some involve me killing to protect myself and its like horror movies on repeat. i havent had the same nightmare twice if that helps .idk what to do or if i should seek help about it. i havent gone through any traumatic event recently, it came from nowhere. when do i start to worry about my nightmares??",Non Depression

I’m getting married and my lovely bride-to-be need some ideas.,"Here’s the thing...the wedding is going to be small, about 50-60 people. My fiancé and I have been worried about a couple of the guests, her father and my sister. 

Her father is definitely the life of the party and will say whatever to whoever while lightly to heavily intoxicated. He will probably try to hold 3-4 toast speeches. 

My sister is a recovering alcoholic - which is great - but she is also very annoying and doesn’t stop posting daily life quotes and judges anyone who does drink and can control themselves. She’s becoming a little bit of a narcissist. 

The guests as a group altogether aren’t the dancing type of people.

Started a new job I am totally new to. Being ridiculed and subsequently made to feel bad about myself,"Started a new job I am totally new to and being ridiculed and made to feel bad about myself

So I started a new job in January of which I have never done before so everything is new to me. Apparently there is a great deal to learn and it can take 6-12 months to learn the job and even afterwards you're still learning. So I have been put on a shift with two guys approximately 5/6 years older than me (I'm 26 M). When I first started they were kind of helpful and understanding of my lack of knowledge. But after four or so weeks I could visibly see the anger on their faces if I make a mistake and they have started to ridicule me and be very condescending. For example the main guy who is training me looks over everything single thing I'm doing over my shoulder and points out mistakes before I have the chance to figure them our for myself in order to retain said knowledge. There are many more examples of this and other type of behaviour towards me which makes me very uncomfortable and therefore not in the best headspace to learn properly. Especially when I'm made to feel like an idiot for asking a question and not have it explained fully. 

It's making me really anxious and unhappy and I'm unsure of what to do as I am a temporary worker at the moment and I feel like they hold all the power over me and know it so take pleasure in making me feel stupid. 

Side note: I also kind of think that because I have been to university and those two haven't, they feel great that they know more than me and love bringing me down saying stuff like 'how have you been to university, you can't even do X or X'

"Membership stores (Costco, Sam's Club) can solve the hoarding crisis. Why don't they?","tl;dr: Costco, institute a block at the checkout which limits purchases of toilet paper, rice, and hand sanitizer to 1 purchase per membership every 2 weeks.

Have you seen the videos of the hoarders racing through Costco as soon as they open in order to buy 5 or 10 packs of toilet paper? (Enough for a year of bathroom activities for most people.).  Costco has now instituted a 2-item limit for key items like toilet paper and paper towels, but that doesn't go far enough, because the hoarders persist -- toilet paper disappears within the first 30 minutes of the store opening.  Why?  Because the people with toilet paper stocked to the roof of their garage just had to buy more this morning.  In fact, they were so desperate to buy more that (according to the manager at my local store) they had to call the police to control the crowd.

Wait, there's a solution...

Costco has a history of all of my purchases.  If they were to check my membership, they'd notice that I haven't purchased TP in over 6 weeks.  But, if I went in tomorrow, I wouldn't be able to buy any.  Why?

All Costco has to do is implement a software solution at the registers.  It really is very simple.  Track the purchase history of key items that are being hoarded. Rather than implementing a limit of how many items a person can buy at a time, limit the number of those items that can be purchased every 2 weeks.  When you get to the register, if you've already purchased 50 packs that week, sorry you can't buy more.  You might want to leave some for the non-hoarders.

So, my PSA question to all the membership stores is the following:  Why haven't you done this already?  Why are you allowing the insanity to persist?  NOT doing this is downright reckless, as you're endangering your patrons. (Clearly if you have to call the police because you're afraid for the safety of your own employees, you've already allowed the line to be crossed)",Non Depression

My boyfriend likes transporn and slept with a transwoman,"

Me and my boyfriend have been together now for a 3 years. We live together and our relationship is really healthy. He loves me very much and i also love him more than everything. I would take a bullet for him but long story short: 

He told me couple weeks ago that he likes to watch transporn and to be honest i got bit confused. I asked him if that is something that straight men watch bcuz i’ve never heard any of my guy friends mentioning transporn. So whatever i let it slide bcuz it’s just a fetish/fantasia. We all have our fantasies. Then couple days ago he told me that he had sex with a transwoman (little bit before we met). I got really really confused. He told me that he ”fucked” her and they both perfomed oral sex on each other. He also told me that it was a one time thing. That after it he was really disgusted and asked himself what was he thinking. He described me the feeling that it was liie when you watch some weird porn and then after masturbating and cuming you feel disgusted and really disappointed in yourself. So i asked him if that is something he likes and told it won’t happen again. 

Now i’m so lost and i don’t know what to do. This is all i think about every morning i wake up and when i’m going to sleep. What should i do? Am i too selfish if i leave him? I love him so much but this is eating me inside. All i do is cry all the time. I can’t focus on anything i’m lost. I’m schoked that i even found word to write this. Some of yall probably won’t understand my reaction. Help me please!! Can i get over this somehow?

What was wrong with my legs?,"So when I was about 10 my legaroonies stopped working. I could feel them but I just couldn’t stand or move.. it was as if I was paralyzed from the waist down ( my pp did still work though ). 

It all started one day when I awoke from a mesmerizing slumber, I stood up, ready for my day ahead of me to begin. I knew something was strange when I stood up and my ankles became oodles amounts of sore. I didn’t role them, I didn’t run or do anything too strenuous but for some odd reason they hurted. 

The previous days I was sick ass can be. I was regurgitating and emptying my bowels of everything that I could bequeath upon my gullet. So I already wasn’t going to school for the week but I did have to accommodate my mother on her daily routines. 

Any-who after a day of sore ankles I finished the night with a perfect regurgitation and another night of orgasmic dreaming. For the next day would be my reckoning....

As the next the sunshine arose so doth I. With my peers (brothers, and mother) sitting along side at the round table of my palace in which I lived... I arose. But unbeknownst to I, my legaroonies hath becomith thy noodleoonies. Instantly as I was heading the floor I realized I had lost something.... all my legaroonies capabilities. 

The rest of the day my families had thought I was a faker. But joke on them, I was not faking. 

My legaroonies were not working. 

I began to do as I had before. Follow my women (mother) around for her daily routing. For close to a fortnight my family had thought I was faking. Yet again I was no fake. I was an honest boy. 

After days and days of not being able to hold my solids and liquids down I began to fall very ill as did my body whenever I would try to thrust myself to a proper stance ( just standing up ). 

Eventually my blood, my life giver, my mommy, would bring me to the hospital. Me being young and incapable of walking she’d laid me down nice and sweet into a chair with wheels. 

As the doctor gazed upon my legaroonies he hath noticed that indeed they had become... noodleoonies...

He left the room in a quick blur for he had the medicine that would give me a quick cure....

For he had the pill that would save me for the rest of my days....

I’m smart and can focus at home but since I graduated high school with a low GPA my options for a good education now are seemingly scarce, and in-classroom classes are extremely hard for me to sit and focus through. I twitch and get panicky and anxious whenever material gets challenging or I feel uncomfortable.

Why won’t amazon help ?,"I’m looking for help. I’m a AV installer, I ordered a Tv from amazon on Friday Feb 28th, I received the tv Monday and installed it that day for my client. I then received a call from an older client who’s card I also had on amazon account and was told that I charged the tv to his older expired Amex card. He didn’t realize I charged it and assumed it was fraud. After finding out from amex I placed the charge he contacted me to see what the story was. I explained to him of the possible mix up on Amazon’s part and I called them Immediately. I advised them the receipt they provided me showed the correct customer, the correct billing address, &amp; the correct credit card. But they charged the wrong credit card, with the wrong person, the wrong billing address &amp; the wrong credit card. Which mind u was expired. So at this point I’m not sure how any of that went through. But non the less the amazon rep was very nice and informed me because the charge went through I didn’t have to worry. I explained to her that the charge went through the wrong customer and the charge needed to go through my correct customer. She then stated there is nothing she can do because the charge already cleared. She stated if I want, I could just return the tv for a refund  then just reorder the tv. I educated her that I had just finished mounting the Tv above a fireplace and I wasn’t about to remove the tv and remount it. I proceeded to figure out how to correct this with her for the next hour she had no solutions. Her final thought was just to pay my old customer the funds that were taken from his account. I advise thats not possible because my current customer wanted to get points on his amex for this transaction. After going back and forth with me telling her to correct the purchase I got no where. And she advised for me just to send the old customer the fees and resolve issue. Embarrassing I called my old customer and updated him on the error. He was completely fine with situation and didn’t have any problems with that. I also advised my current customer and educated him what happen and he understood also and wrote me a check for the TV, which I immediately transferred to my old customers account. Everything is fine. All the issues are resolved. 
3 days later my amazon account was locked. All my Amazon was locked!! All my TVs (fire sticks) all my amazon echos, dots, kindles, door locks, everything. I was completely shut down! I couldn’t figure out what was going on, then I got the email.....  yada yada yada.. “there was fraudulent activity on my account so your account is being locked to correct the payment info for $2700 tv purchase”  so at this point I’m like wtf! I already fixed this. I paid the dude. We’re good. So this auto generated email they sent me had a hyperlink to click to access my account and update or respond. But the problem is I can’t click the link because my account is locked! I have no way of logging in. So I replied to email explaining issue. And all I get is an auto generated message. So after countless tries I finally get a 800 number to call. But the 800 number says the can’t help me cause fraud department doesn’t have phone support only email support. So after 4 hours on the phone the customer service manger states she will update info and email them. I went through this everyday for the next 7 days. Getting now where. I keep replying to auto generated email with everything they asking for. But still no reply’s. Just auto generated emails. 2 weeks later after making daily calls, I finally get some tech that is willing to escalate me to his manger. This guys knows exactly what’s going on. I’m batting 1000. He knows all the right answers and after another 3 hours he finally says. This wasn’t transfers to the correct fraud Dept. He makes me feel awesome He goes on to tell me how transparent he is and this can take 3-5 more business days to get resolved. He states these thing can take some time. So after 26 calls, 8 emails, 2 letters to Jeff Bezos, 6 twitters I’m still exactly where u was 18 days ago. I still have not received one email stating this issue is being worked on. 1 call stating they are aware. Nothing. My business is installation. I order from amazon every single day.

I am a pretty physically large guy, 6’4”, 260 pounds (not “cut”, but not “fat”) and I’m very strong for a non-power lifter. I am the runt in my family.

I don’t intimidate people intentionally. When in a room of many people, I lean on something so I’m shorter. I sit if possible. I never really stand up unless I need to. 

In short, my question is just, basically, do other men feel threatened when their ex’s boyfriend/their friend/random passerby/other men are physically larger? Is this an instinctual thing? Is this outdated? I find it annoying. I’m fairly tranquil and it gets old, fast.

Anyone felt this??,"I don’t really know where to post this or what to do but here I go. yesterday I lost a good friend and a brother in an accident. Purest selfless person out there, gets hit and boom just like that. About a month and a half ago over the course of a few days I got a sense and feeling of death. I couldn’t figure out if it was me , sensing my death. It was kinda like I would get hit with a feeling of uncertainly/fear/tragic loss all in one. I can’t really explain it but I knew it, It felt as if someone I knew very much or me would die, something impactful. I tried putting it together and even told my best friend about it and I forgot about it. Sometimes I would feel it but as time went on I kinda just ignored it. Yesterday March 14, 2020 I got the news that my homie was hit avoiding an accident and I just lost it. I didn’t realize it then but I did later, I never thought these sensations would come true, I just felt like it was my mind playing tricks and now I’m wondering what the hell is happening. Here’s the thing, 2 days prior from the accident m on March  12,2020 I was at bdubs, picking up a to go order. The lady said nobody called in an order (even though my brother did) so I went ahead and placed one and went to my car waiting. Fast forward 10 minutes I go back to check if it’s ready and as I’m paying I see him (one who passed)   And he’s with another friend (both involved in the accident) and I waved at them. As I proceeded to pay and walk out , before I could even open the door I get that sensation of (go back and say hi). It hit me and I went ahead and did, said hi to them , asked em what they ate and the last things I said to them was “be safe”. The friend he was with is okay, few broken ribs, I am not as close to him but I fw him. fast forward to now I’m still taking it all in, I’ve had dreams come true but never something like this. What made me go back and talk to them??  I’m grateful I did , I’m grateful for being able to say a few last things to him before he passed. I’m grateful for that order not going through the first time, I lost someone who I never made enough memories with. Everybody loves him, such a selfless soul. I’m trying coming to terms with whatever I felt and his passing but it’s just a train wreck. And to top it off , that morning of his passing , I saw his mom at the gym around 9am before it all happened. I wanna think this is all a big coincidence but signs were all there, what’s the odds I’d run into them both back to back. Crazy to think that at that time, everyone was their normal selves before it happened and now some people’s lives will never be the same.

"I work in an office with close to 1,000 people, and they are doing nothing about the Coronavirus.","I should start off by saying I’m not going to mention the company or what state I’m located in, (US). But it is spreading rapidly where I am. Schools, retailers and other businesses have been shut down. Everyone I know has been sent to work from home.

I will tell you the company I work for is massive, and has plenty of money. They are refusing to let us work from home, saying that it is not possible and that everything is business as usual. They have no plan in place. They have not cancelled unnecessary meetings, they are still packing tiny conference rooms full and shutting the door. When the question came up of “what will we do when someone in our office gets it?” The answer we got was; “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” 

My partner is very high risk with auto immune disorder. I am scared to go to work. I have been using my paid time off to avoid the office. It seems like the CEO and higher ups do not give a damn if us or our families get the virus, they just want to milk every penny they can. I truly do not know what to do. I keep taking days off hoping I get an email that a plan was put in place. On a day I did go to the office last week, two people who I work near showed up with flu like symptoms.

Im just struggling at the moment because my housemate keeps inviting his girlfriend up for at least a week and normally without telling me. This happens regularly and whilst I dont mind every other weekend or so whole weeks of her always being in the flat is hard. 

It's worse at the moment because were both going to be working from home for the foreseeable future and its hard with that extra person also working from home.

How do I ask another friend who is my partner’s cousin to be my bridesmaid because the other one backed out?,Bit of a long read sorry.

There is absolutely no negative feelings or anything like that and I still asked her to stay in the bridal group to share her ideas and stuff and we both agreed it would be best for her to just attend as a guest.

My wife’s in law school and has no time for us,"This is obviously a throwaway account.

Two years ago, my wife decided to go to law school. I told her the only way I was letting her was if she got a full-ride scholarship to a T14. I never thought she’d be able to do so.

So she did, unfortunately for me. She quit her job in customer service. 

I’ve been taking care of our toddler daughter AND also work full time. My job doesn’t pay that well, but the hours are very lenient and enable me to take care of our daughter.

My wife never has time for us anymore. I feel like a second priority. All she does is study all the time. There’s no cheating involved because she studies in the spare room at home, so I know exactly what she’s up to.

My parents are angry at my wife. According to them, she has a college degree. They want her to quit law school and return to her old job, because back then she had more time for us. While she hated her job, once she wasn’t at work, she had all the time for us. My daughter and I both need her in our lives.

This has been affecting me because I agree with my parents. But I know my wife will react badly to it because she’s been doing well so far in school.

Mucus in stool,"
Hey y’all, sorry for the gross details. But i had some light diarrhea since yesterday, and i thought i had to go to the toilet 2 times today and only thing that came out was a (majorly) odorless, clear/brownish mucus liquid that came out. 

I don’t have any particular pain or so. With all this Cvirus stuff i’m extremely anxious and more hypochondriac than usual. Also had some cheese yesterday which i don’t usually eat so maybe that played it’s part.

Already had this sometimes months/years ago, pretty rarely tho. No major complaints beside extreme anxiety and stress due to this whole situation.

I’ve grown fond of this guy, (I’ll call him Ryan) 

It’s been over a month and a bit. Although, Ryan has a girlfriend (they just hit 7 months)

Long story short, there has been two moments where I thought he was flirting (a “friendly” forehead kiss, (a week and a half later) a whistle at me from him when we were leaving the bar/restaurant after having drinks with friends)

Honestly he’s a nice guy, he is! But that’s what I’m struggling with, is he being nice? Friendly? Playful?
I started to realize I’ve grown fond of him, like a huge crush but I’m trying so damn hard to hide it.

What are some mixed signals that could be misunderstood?
Change of tone? (Different tone of voice when speaking with me- sometimes softer)
Random conversation starts? 
One thing that confuses me, he won’t reply back to texts, yet when I leave the building sometimes he’ll text me right after I leave. Like this could be a text from the day before, earlier in the morning, two days ago, etc.
Sometimes I’ll catch him glancing over at me from the corner of my eye, but it’s like he looks and looks away immediately, like to not be caught?

I’m being respectful of the fact he’s in a relationship, no flirting, etc. But...I can’t fucking understand what the hell he’s going with this? Can he like...”man-sense” my crush on him? 
Doe she wanna be friends or is he like...just as confused as I am?

What is the random mind game that you play with yourself that has no real consequences but you irrationally still make yourself play them?,"I used to think I was crazy until I saw a meme (the one where a couple has thought bubbles and girl thinks the guy is thinking about something inappropriate but he is shown to be thinking an innocent thought) where a guy was jogging past a girl and his thought bubble aid something like “if I don’t run to that tree before that car passes the tree, I will die”.

Does anyone else give themselves these insanely irrational challenges?

The current game I play is when I am folding laundry. I take my clothes out one at a time and when I find a sock, I have the throw it randomly into the pile of other socks. The game starts when I have to match the pairs. I am allowed to use 2 hands, but can only pick up one sock with each hand. I must find a pair without moving the pile. If I accidentally pick up socks that do not match or grab them the same sock with both hands and lose. 

The consequences for losing? I will die in the next 24 hours. My irrational brain creates this absurd consequence. Now that I am 34 and more pragmatic, I penalize myself with having to wear the mismatched socks. 

Other more common examples:
- if you step on a crack in the sidewalk, your mother will break her back
- if you say “Bloody Mary in the mirror three times in the dark, she will appear and kill you” (I literally had a hard time not saying Bloody Mary in my head every time I saw a mirror in the dark into my 20s)
- really any superstition, but I create my own 

Are there any psychologists or psychiatrists out there who can tell me if this is common or not? My self-analysis is that I love puzzles so much that I can turn mundane tasks like laundry into fun challenges. My consequences might be a little harsh though.

TL;DR I invent games in my head that I have to play and superstitiously think I will die if I don’t win the game.",Non Depression

Whats the worst experience you had under Anesthesia?,"Heres mine...


i had lipo in colombia, and the doctor sorta missed a spot on my right flank which i mentioned and he told me when i come back, hell do a do over ill just have to pay for anesthesia.

Well i did come back, 2 years later. i guess the doctor didnt expect me too. He seemed upset cuz now i was prying into his busy schedule. So he left me as the last patient of the day, mind u there’s a difference btw anesthesia.. either ur awake, half awake, fully alseep. Which all ranged in different prices. For some reason i felt like he was trying to give me the worst trip of anesthesia. By trying to convince to get the half sedated anesthesia cause it was cheap in price. I made it clear i dont care ill pay whatever it took to be fully asleep. Which i did n it cost me 2k which it shouldnt of since i was in colombia. And the price is way cheaper like 800.

Once the doctor came to the clinic, like i imagined he was annoyed which scared me. N i tried bein nice n tellin him im sorry, n plz be gentle with me. I had a friend with me that didnt help much, she was opening a recovery home n was trying to recruit him under her wing as a dr that will refer patience to recover at her facility after his procedures. well she was askin him questions at the wrong time.. she was asking while he was marking my body up with a marker on where to lipo me. He seemed annoyed as hell with her and i told her to leave the room he doesnt seem happy. Moving forward...

I was placed under sedation and when i tell u it wasnt general anesthesia and i was in the twilight zone, i was in the twilight zone forreal. It got so surreal it started off with me hearing music for some reason then with  the beat of the music my vision started to zoom into my body until i seen each of my veins flowing in my body to the beat of this song-which i cant remember what song it was. As it went on i was able to see each of my blood cells moving along my body like traffic on a map/ like ur gps, all my cells was just traveling. It was a horrifying experience.. with the beat math problems started to form all over, like science equations that took hours which is what it felt like.. then i started to feel like i was aware of my surroundings but everyone started to sound like robots around me and I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I started to feel as if i was in a coma n never coming out of it. No matter what i did in my mind nothing was helping. I started to freak out and little by little i started to hear them a little bit better.. i also have terrible spanish which my spanish became great for some reason n i was holding a full convo with 3 nurses that I couldn’t see at all. In spanish i was asking them where is my doctor.. i need to speak to him. He lied to me and purposely gave me anesthesia that he knew would make me freak out. They started to laugh at me and make fun of me. Now i started to cry n tell them why r they doing this to me. They were calling me all types of names, callin me a cry baby and makin sounds like waahh waaah.. mimicking a baby crying. I told them if i ever get out of this blind coma like state im going to see who is doing this to me, that it isnt right to treat patients like this.

I was then focused on sitting myself up without being able to see, trying everything to reassure myself. i wasn’t paralyzed or in a coma. I needed to get out of that situation quick. All the while they were makin fun of me. Im assuming they do this alot to patients knowing when to do so cuz were completely out of commission. N im assuming they do this judgement on how the patient isnt moving so we must b under full anesthesia still but as soon as i was able to move n reach my hand underneath myself n pull up slightly, these nurses changed their tone of voice and the old bat that was mocking me crying n callin me a cry baby in spanish completely became this caring nurse sayin to relax and so forth.. i screamed soooo loud, i screamed in a panic yelling my friends name that was outside in the waiting room she started banging on the door for them to open it and started telling them whats wrong n what were they doing to me. I told her everything and she started to argue with them n told them ive never seen her like this and that they were lying n they had to do something. I couldnt believe what went on and how these nurses changed so quickly their attitude was appalling.

But over all the experience freaked me out. I would cry for weeks about the situation and how i felt helpless and in a coma. Everything i envisioned which i cant completely remember all the details shook me. For months it was damaging to me, ive read on stories with similar experiences where people have committed suicide after an experience like mines, having surgery under anesthesia that u can feel everything n so forth.

Seeking advice!! Traveling in an RV to national parks for unknown amount of time.,"Living off 100% P&amp;T while traveling America in an RV for an unknown amount of time.

Exactly what it says. I am asking because my wife thinks I’m nuts (not disagreeing) and wants to see if this even a semi intelligent decision. 

Information about us:
We have been married for 9 years, but knew each other for about 14 years now.
I am make a 6 figure salary and we have nearly no debt. Between my salary and the disability we make more money than we need. We save about 4K a month. I hate my job, really really hate my job. I feel like without the type of drugs I take I would probably be borderline homicidal because I hate people now, it’s not even that I hate the specific individual, I hate that they are in my personal space and feel threatened. Haven’t found the exact space, but much much larger bubble than the space being in traffic on a 6 lane highway. 

My wife sells her photography and handles everything around the house. I have had seven TBIs in my career and bad PTSD so I am quite forgetful and she helps me out with everything. She recently had three hand surgeries on her dominant hand so she is rehabbing currently and really is concentrating on her photography. 

I am ex Special Forces, 18C, important only because it adds to part of the equation of my willingness to take a risk, adapt and overcome. 
My wife has CPTSD and Panic disorder, which leads to her really wanting a plan and sticking to it and everything very calculated.  I am very impulsive now and she has saved us from compulsive deals from $600 to one that was just over $1,000,000 (four plex in HCOL area). 

I want to say fuck it all, sell and what we do not need, store what we do not want to take and travel in an RV. I have never really found myself or know who I really am, I spent 10 years in the military and now I am kind of lost in life. Plus I love nature and the idea of being away from a lot of people. I am going to start astrophotography so being in secluded areas would help that as well. My wife is actually a social butterfly once her guard is down so it is than interesting dilemma. 

We have 40k in savings, after buying an RV, and only $490 in recurring debt. 

RV wouldn’t be anything grandiose, more humble,but we plan on ensuring the main components are ready for our trip and we would spend about 30 days rehabbing the inside. 

We would start the trip in September and go from there. We are in the PNW so we would head south. From the redwoods I have no plans, but again that part is not a big deal to me as we would figure it out. 

The biggest problem is this:

I have NO exit strategy.  I do not really know who I am, what my hobbies are (trying astrophotography because I am interested in knowing more about space). I have no exit strategy because I have no plan in life and continuing down the path of this corporate world is not what I want. This is something I am hoping will help me find myself and be able to do something I enjoy while spending quality time with the person I love the most. 

Seeking guidance please.",Non Depression

We are lost.,"Troubled stepson...

Okay here is goes. I’ve been in my stepsons life since he was 4. He will be 8 in about a month and a half. My husband has him every other weekend and sometimes every other week during the summer. In that time I’ve noticed a serious increase of neglect on his moms part, I mean yes she “takes” care of his basic needs but doesn’t think about the emotional aspect of raising any child. So he started showing obvious signs that he’s wanting his moms attention. At one point he started calling me mom by accident and calling his mom by my name as well as being very inappropriate with me. My husband and I had to have a conversation about not touching girls in their “no no spots” because his mother wasn’t. It was also getting to the point he was hurting his cat at his moms house and tried choking my dog while he was here. We’ve broken him of hurting any animal we have at our house but not sure how things go when he’s at his moms. When he is at his moms house he does beat on his little brother pretty bad from what his mom has told my husband. When he was in school, he would throw horrible temper tantrum. A lot of the time they would get so bad they would have to take all the kids out of the room and let him calm down. He has thrown scissors at teachers and bullied other students. All the while this is happening, his mom was always late bringing him into school and also 1-2 hours early picking him up. While I’m first grade, it got so bad he missed 98 days of school for whatever reason. 

Things seemed to be going okay for a year and a half until he started lying about everything and pretended not knowing how to do simple tasks. We’ve had talks to him about it and even showing him countless times. We ended up chalking this up to his moms doing because negative attention is better than no attention. 

We are now battling him wanting to play more than to eat. He would barely eat anything we give him. And when he is hungry, he doesn’t say anything. He is so skinny, you can see every rib and every bone in his spine. We’ve talked to his mom about this and all she says is “he just had a high metabolism.”

So my husband and I had a baby together and he just turned 8 months old. Up until our son was born my step was the only child at our house for 8 years. We can tell he’s having a hard time with sharing the attention. 


The most recent thing that’s most bothersome to me was I found a lego on the floor and with my son being at crawling stage and putting everything in his mouth. I told my step son he has to be careful with where he has his legos and he seemed confused so I explained to him that my son can choke and he goes but I like my legos and I proceeded to explain to him that if my son chokes on one of his legos he could die and all he said was “I don’t care if he chokes and dies cause I don’t care about him.” I was so shocked because he’s got a little brother and a little sister at his moms house. 

I had a serious talk with my husband about my concerns for our son because of his older sons history of violence towards his class mates and teachers. 

I get that he has some issues that need to be resolved with a therapist, even though his mother says he’s seeing the one at his school. I get he’s got some anger built up but I’m becoming extremely afraid he will hurt my son. Both my husband and I have had nightmares because of this. I’m getting to the point where I just don’t know what to do anymore and not wanting him around my son.

We have also talked to him about maybe living with us during the week and visiting his mom on the weekends and he said no he want to stay with his mom. 

I feel most bad for my husband because he’s stuck in the middle but I also feel responsible for the well being of my son. What should we do?",Non Depression

How would life evolve in a McDonald’s dimension?,"**Tl;dr Imagine a world came into existence made of McDonald’s restaurants.  Now, imagine that every animal on earth is placed inside of this universe, along with every McDonald’s employee.  How does life adapt to this new world over time?**



Upon this universe’s inception, all 1.7 million current McDonald’s employees spawn at their workstations in “their” restaurant.  Customers don’t spawn with them.  When an employee dies, they stay dead.


Each McDonald’s in this restaurant consists of the entire McDonald’s property, including the parking lot and drive thru.  However, at the border of where each McDonald’s property would end, are three story high concrete walls and ceiling over the top of the building.  So, there is no sunlight.  The concrete above and below each building stretches out infinitely.  Things like gravity and pressure from this concrete don’t exist.


At the north, east, south, and west sides of these walls are four metre high and wide, square arches, and on each side of these arches is a replica of another random existing McDonald’s restaurant.


Every animal spawns parallel to where they are in the real world.  So, for example.  If your dog was on a boat, with a bird flying above them, a fish swimming below them, and a gorilla five kilometres away from them, then your dog, the bird, and fish would all spawn within the same McDonald’s restaurant, while the gorilla would spawn in a restaurant five kilometres away from them.  Nothing would spawn inside of a wall or object.  Just imagine the entire terrain of earth gets flattened and replaced with McDonald’s chains.


Employees only spawn “once”, in their own McDonald’s, where they work.  So, while each restaurant connected to each other is random, and there are several duplicates of each particular one, there aren’t multiple clones of the same employee in every “clone” restaurant.


The temperatures in the outdoor section of each McDonald’s would be the same heat level of that restaurants position relative to where and when it would be IRL.  So, the parking lot of a McDonald’s in the equator during the day would be the same heat, and far hotter than a McDonald’s hundreds of miles south “in Antarctica”.  The restaurants still have air conditioning.


Plant and fungi spores floating in the air DO spawn in this universe, but macro plants like trees do not, unless they are plants already on a McDonald’s property irl.  No animals spawn in walls.  There is no wind or weather in the parking lot.


Things like food, soda, soap, oil, gloves, paper bags, toilet paper, and water from the sink, magically restocks at the end of each day.  It only restocks to one day’s worth of that resource that that McDonald’s would typically use in one day.


The only natural light sources are the fluorescent lighting and displays like electronic monitors.  The electricity never runs out, but there is no internet connection.  Everything flushed down the toilet gets erased from the universe.


Human tools like phones, glasses, ear piercings, and cars don’t spawn in.  Things like mops, that are used to do the job, do spawn in, as well as stuff like pictures hanging on the wall.

The buildings don’t decay or collapse as they age, like real buildings do.  They also don’t decay radioactively.  There is no problem like heat buildup or entropy.



Questions:

* How would animals evolve abilities like mobility, sight, sound, etc. — is what would everything end up looking like?

* Would humans revert to a hunter gatherer society?

* What would people’s jobs be?

* Would there be a class system?

* What would music be like?  What would be used as instruments?

* How would the environment effect human warfare?

* What would be the primary choice of weapons?

* Would humans have a form of money?  What would they use as currency?  What would be the major products sold?

* What lifeforms would inhabit the play areas where humans aren’t around?

* How would each type of animal fare?  Eg. Dogs, cats, primates, fish, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates?  Birds?  Cassowaries, penguins, songbirds.  Bugs?  Flies, mosquitoes, bees, ants, worms.

* Would birds evolve into raptor-like creatures with opposable thumbs?

* Would any fish survive in the toilets/soda machines?

* What would happen in the restaurants parallel to zoos irl?

* How different would it be from life in the infinite Burger King universe?

* Would Ronald McDonald, Grimace, etc. become deity-like figures?

* What would humans evolve into over time?

CoronaVirus Michigan Mid-December Story,"Nobody believes me but I believe I had the coronavirus Mid December in Michigan. It started with a sore throat one night at work. Pretty much leading into a really bad cold starting the next morning. I worked at a place called Zingermans Mail Order in Ann Arbor, MI overnights. My position had a lot of dust in the work area so I would wear a N95 mask to cover my lungs and protect from dust mites. One particular night my throat began to hurt I figured it was dry and I was thirsty. Kept drinking water never got better got worst by the end of my shift. Following the next morning I called off for my shift. I figured the dust made me sick after searching symptoms. Within the next 3-4 days my cold was horrible and my throat was super sore, I had lost my voice and sounded terrible, I had a very bad cough that literally wouldn’t stop. I play basketball and workout everyday but I would run out of breath from simply talking or walking or running very short distances. My body was aching and sore. During the night when I slept, I would begin sweating and take a cover off and then within 10-15 minutes I would shiver and be cold and go back to wrapping myself up. I was sweating so bad my sheets would be soaked and my chest was slippery. I went to the doctor they told me I had a virus from basically a normal cold and a fever but I did not have the flu. I was given medicine but after continuously taking it I barely got better. At my appointment I was told if I didn’t feel better in 3-5 days return to the doctor. Finally one day I started feeling better and went back to work the following day. The same night by the end of the shift I was back in the same position except worst. My cough was non stop, my fever was back, my body ached, my nose ran non stop with sneezing, I still didn’t have my voice back. I could barely finish one sentence and I was out of breathe. I told my girlfriend I believe the dust mites scarred my lungs, because I can’t breathe the same. I went to an urgent care (Different doctor)after a few days and informed them I went to the doctor previously and the symptoms have persisted for atleast a week and a half. I was wheezing, coughing, and had shortness of breath. I was treated with a Nebulizer which is an breathing treatment that expands the lungs and I used it for about 15 minutes. Directly after I felt great but later on my symptoms persisted for about 3-4 more days. Finally I got well and it was the sickest I ever had gotten. Due to me believing it was dust mites I quit my job at Zingermans. I have a girlfriend named Isley who can vouch for me and my experience, although she doesn’t believe it was possible I had Covid-19 because she thinks she would’ve gotten infected and sick. I might even have text messages from my co workers still explaining that I was sick! I promise I couldn’t make this up. Do you believe this is possible? Share my story please!",Non Depression

Expectations,"

I need some clarity on my life.

I am 29 years old and I grew up in an Indian family raised in America.  I love my parents a lot, but I often feel like there is always pressure to maintain cultural values and to be honest, while I don't necessarily think Indian Culture is all bad, I don't believe in a lot of the traditions and customs, but I do appreciate other things like food, art, medicine and music.

Yes I already know my parents want the best for me, but I just can only accept that as an excuse so many times.

My mom keeps asking when I'll get married and she asked why I would not want to meet someone through parents circle of friends and what is wrong with sites like Shaadi.com or bharat matrimony.

Here are my reasons I'd never want to meet friends through parents network

1. If I say no, my parents will say I'm being too picky and my dad will start getting confrontational and it'll lead to all sorts of arguments.
2. Someone else will get hurt and my parent's friends will get mad
3. Even if I did manage to meet them, there is almost always some sort of 3rd party involvement and they will always want to know how it's going and keep tabs on whether the relationship is on track towards marriage instead of them minding their own business.
4. Most Indian girls my age or younger are not going to want to be setup by their parents anyways and I prefer a strong independent woman who can think for herself.

Here is why I absolutely hate Shaadi.com or bharat matrimony.  

1.  It is shallow - I once created a fake account to see how it really is and I had to list my salary on there.  Most of the profiles on their started with ""I am finishing my Masters in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the end of May and looking for husband with good family background.  

I have no information about their personality, interests, hobbies and who they are at the core.

2.  Half of the profiles are made by Parent's themselves.  This was a major red flag for me because either the woman is way too lazy or just doesn't really care about she ends up with because if she really did, she'd make an effort herself to at least make her own profile and also she's more than likely traditional if she's ok with that and I don't want a traditional indian woman because I don't want a woman who's willing to say ""yes"" to everything just because I'm her husband, it's fucking stupid.  Also there are parents that make these profiles and their children don't even know they are on it.  I'm not talking to parents.

&amp;#x200B;

   3. If you're looking to meet someone and date them for a couple years before even getting married, it's very rare to find someone like that on these sites.

&amp;#x200B;

  4. People get married based on Education, family background, wealth and even caste.  

First of all everyone and their mom has a college degree these days and a good job, it's much harder these days to attract women based on those two things than in the past because women don't need a husband in their life to manage and they are more independent than ever.  

Also notice, I didn't put romantic and emotional attraction on there because they are trying to logically match with someone based on the other points above and emotional and romantic attraction takes time.

5. These sites take the fun out of dating.  Dating is about meeting people and connecting with them on an emotional level and when all you think about is wanting to get hitched, you don't even take the time to enjoy and appreciate the moment in front of you.  

Dating is much more rewarding even though you'll get rejected, but you become emotionally resilient through it, but you'll also find amazing women who you truly connect with and that's really important.  Even if it doesn't always lead to a ring on her finger, those experiences shape and they don't go to waste.  

My mom looks at dating as a formality and a tool to develop into marriage while I view marriage as a right of passage rather than a goal.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my my answer to my mom on these two questions, I also added that ""I don't owe anyone an explanation on why I do or don't want to do something.""

FYI, these are my experiences from these sites.

Here is another point I'd like to make

My parents paid for my college and I am truly grateful for them for that and everything else they've done for me, but when it came to allowing me be my own man and have my own views of the world and live by them, I never had that opportunity.  I know some people might be thinking I'm lucky for parents paying for college, which I am, but I always felt like I had to manage their cultural expectations and I just can't do it anymore.  It takes a toll on my mentally and emotionally to the point where I feel like I'm always limited.  Sometimes full independence is taken for granted and that's more valuable than money.

I do feel like because they paid for my college I feel obligated to manage their cultural expectations but at the same time, I also realize that I'm an adult and I'm fully independent and it's not my job to manage their cultural expectations.  I feel like because I made something of myself and I'm not violating any basic human principles not cultural or religious values, that I did my part.  

Here are examples of cultural expectations I don't agree on

1. No Pre-marital sex
2. No live-in relationships
3. Being married by a certain age

In my opinion I don't feel I owe any obligation because they paid for my college at this point since I'm financially independent and have my own place.

At the end of the day, I don't want to be 55 and angry and resentful towards them because I feel like I'm there already.

Here are the questions I have

1. Are my answers justified above for questions regarding matrimonial sites and meeting people through family friends?
2. Even though my parents paid for my college, am I still obligated to meet their cultural expectations even though it's subjective?",Non Depression

A little background before I start...
This is a throw away account and I only have it to get genuine advice. I’m completely serious and I would appreciate everyone to not judge me to badly...
Okay to start off, you may be wondering what my previously mentioned addiction I have  acquired, the answer being pain. I am extremely addicted to pain, at least I believe so.
Growing up, I’ve always been fascinated with the idea of personal pain. I can remember that most of my early childhood was spent sitting on the ground near a fence so ants could crawl on and bite me. It may not sound like very much, but it slowly became more and more extreme. I would pull my teeth out with hangers and mess with permanent ones just because it hurt.  I’d also look forward to getting hang nails as well as those little flappy pieces of skin on your finger. 
As I stated before, it grew more intense as the years went on. I was soon sticking sowing needles, paper clips, and clothes pins deep into my arms and hands. And before I knew it, I was cutting my arms and legs with knives and razor blades. My mom actually began to catch on to me because of how often I wore long clothing despite being in a place that is really hot. She found out and put all the knives away (which I responded to by cutting small chunks of my tongue with kids scissors)
I would go through periods where I’d starve myself of food as well as water just so I could have a migraine. I went to such lengths as to make myself vomit just because it felt good. Though I have had difficulties in the past concerning my weight, but it seemed like  a less important thing to me at the time. I’m actually still suffering from a iron, vitamin B, and vitamin D because of my poor eating decisions.
I am to afraid to report this to others around me (Such as my mother and psychiatrist) because my sibling had gone through a phase where she got into physical fights and my mother was forced to send her to a mental hospital for 2 weeks. She always tells me how bad it is and that I should avoid it at all costs. I really don’t want to experience that so I refuse to tell others because I fear I might be sent to a mental hospital as well...
Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!",Non Depression

PLEASE! we need to spread the word. i live in Sweden, and the authorities have decided to give up to the coronavirus. they will not test anymore, they are not closing schools they have decided to not do anything to stop the virus. they want us all who live here to get the virus and become immune. (which has not shown yet that we become immune after getting it)  

i am stressed out, the population is stressed out. people are beginning to stay inside, to stay home from school to stay home from worl to bring home the kids even when the authotities can take away their kids for not being in school.

we need help, we need for you to spread the word so more countries are beware of what the fuck is going on here! We are the only country which has given up the fight for corona. Because the authorited simply can not cope. they only protect the people who work in hospitals and elders. Nobody else. 

this is a serious violation of humanitarian principles. we don’t know what to do anymore!

BREAKING: Chinese media attack on Sweden

“Sweden’s surrender to the new Corona virus will harm others and themselves

Swedish officials decided on the 12th to stop the statistics of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia, and the country will no longer test patients with mild symptoms and suspected patients. An official in Stockholm said it was no longer possible to stop the spread of the new Corona outbreak in Sweden. The country's public health agency said it would use its limited resources for high-risk groups such as medical staff and hospitalized patients.

Sweden is the first European country to openly surrender to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, and this country's latest policy is highly irresponsible both for protecting the health of the Swedish population and for working together to fight the global epidemic. A total of 635 cases were diagnosed in Sweden by the 12th, of which 135 cases were newly added on the 12th. This is a very serious situation for a country with a population of 10.12 million.

However, in terms of the level of public health development in Sweden, it is far from being exhausted. In Hubei Province, China, there have been many cities with a population much smaller than Sweden and medical standards lower than Sweden. There have been many more cases than in Sweden at present, but those cities have not given up, and they have recently zero new cases.

Sweden did not attempt to carry out further prevention and control mobilization, it directly gave up its comprehensive resistance to the epidemic, narrowed the anti-epidemic front to a small part of the hospital, and only protected patients and medical staff in the hospital. Laissez-faire is a serious departure from the law of epidemic prevention.

Sweden is acting as an ostrich. In this way, the epidemic situation will need to be further outbreak in Swedish society. More and more patients in critical condition must be hospitalized, and the country's medical system will be under more pressure.

Promoting such a decision is a serious violation of humanitarian principles, and it would be shocking to see it happen first in a developed European country that advertises ""democracy"" and ""human rights.""

In doing so, Sweden is still demolishing and releasing water from the global epidemic. It means that Sweden will be a country where the new Corona epidemic is unrestrained and most cases will lose epidemiological tracking. Sweden will become a black hole in the international fight against epidemics, a hotbed for virus accumulation and attacks on other areas.

In the future, Sweden will pose a huge risk that is difficult to assess in Europe and the wider region. There are many more cases in other countries, but at least it is clear, and Sweden will become a complete mess.

The international community, especially the European Union, should severely condemn Sweden's surrender to the virus. If Sweden's approach is accepted, the world's already fragile anti-epidemic front will break further and collapse, and the long-term consequences will be unimaginable.”",Non Depression

Should I travel to USA amid COVID-19 scare? Details in post.,"My partner and I were planning to fly to Austin, Texas for our good friend’s low-key wedding. We’re scheduled to fly on 3/25 from London, UK, where we live, returning 4/8. It’s direct flight from Heathrow to Austin International Airport. 

We’re thinking whether we should do it or not amid Coronavirus scare. We’ve been waiting for the trip for a long time now, but obviously we want to make the most informed decision possible. BA hasn’t cancelled the flights yet, but they just issued free-of-charge rebooking or a voucher policy, if we were not to fly. 

I’m concerned for our wellbeing, but I’m definitely not panicking yet, just trying to understand how bad it might be if we were to fly, or how likely it might be to have some problems while in the US (quarantine or something).

I also am seeing that millions of Americans contracted H1N1 and tens of thousands died. Why don’t I remember it being a crisis?

I don’t want to super get into details about where I live but I live in the PNW (Pacific North West) and it rains, is cold, dark sometimes and we (mostly me!) need to get out of it. After going to Hawaii in 2017 and Florida this past September 2019, we know we are people who need THAT weather. I am aware of island fever, and the hurricanes and elements but I just need a warm tropical scene. I need the beach, sun, palm trees and warm (and yes HOT!) weather where I’m outside at 9:30PM on the front porch because it’s still warm. 

There is a bit more background to this whole thing but I wanted to give a quick summary to show how much my husband and myself want to up and move to somewhere that best fits the weather and environment we so crave. A small portion of this story also is my husband waiting to match for medical residency so I’m afraid to move and become very happy and find out we have to move to like Chicago for his residency.

What is the point of panic-buying toilet paper?,"Hi all,

Asking out of genuine curiosity and also disgust. Why do you feel the need to stock up on toilet paper?

I understand many people are having irrational urges to a highly unusual situation - our (US) government is giving virtually no fact-based response to the spread of COVID-19, and so there are no other sources of public leadership guiding us through a proper response to it. 

But why the toilet paper?  I assume you, like me, have been exposed to post-apocalyptic fantasies in books and movies- I always thought food and a clean source of drinking water would be the highest on the list. I literally could care less what I wipe my ass with. Plastic bags (RIP, NYC), magazines, newspapers- anything that doesn’t cause a rash. Why are you so friggin’ obsessed with soft, white paper for your chocolate starfish?

Personally, I would be stocking up on highly caloric foods (rice, beans, oils, sugars) and wiping my ass on literally anything I had at hand when nature called. Now I, just trying my best to deal with your panicked bullshit, can’t even by a package of toilet paper at the grocery on my way home from work.

"I become extremely inferior to angry customers. I always forget what I’m doing, making me look even more like an idiot, which makes them even more angry. How do you cope?","I only work at a grocery store, but I’m in nursing school trying to get out of retail and into a better paying job. The unfortunate thing is, nursing does involve dealing with a lot of people. Only reason I mention it is I often times self loathe about how if I can’t handle a stupid grocery store job, how am I going to handle being a nurse? Often times I feel like the idiot of the department. I’m quite slow at understanding things. I think being aloof would be a perfect word to describe me, always in la la land. My words don’t come out the way I want them to. I am easily a ball of nerves, a wreck.

Because of the coronavirus, my grocery store has been wiped out. A lady came by and to my mistake, told her some products were included in her order when they weren’t. It was my fault I didn’t read what was on my phone correctly. But of course she had missing items, because we had so many things out of stock, even peanut butter for goodness sake. She went on a tantrum demanding her things. It was like unleashing a wild snake, extremely authoritarian. All that was left for me to do was bow down and kiss her feet for her to spare me. Now, I used to be even worse in handling these types of situations. I’d run away and cry. Being in retail for 7 years has given me a bit of an advantage to handle my social anxiety and emotions a tad. I guess that has come with age. But what I have a hard time doing is forming coherent sentences when confronted by said vicious snake since I am still pretty nervous. It’s always the same looking Karens doing this to me, but that’s besides the point. 

I feel so defeated when I can’t handle my “battles” and need to call a manager or a team leader, who are all practically my age or slightly older (I’m 24). It’s embarrassing having to pass on my problem on to someone else, who already has enough to deal with on this hectic, busy day. My coworker handled it so effortlessly. The lady was going off about multiple things that far exceeded what the original problem even was and she calmly looked at the snake, laid out some facts and talked to her in a confident manner. Did she end up winning her over and made her happy and all was good? No. She still left pretty ticked off. But what matters is the snake got taken care of, and me, well I felt so ashamed for not being able to defend myself. I kept thinking on wether I should have admitted to misreading her order, or try to emphasize that we don’t have many of the items she ordered and apologized. 

When people get too overwhelming for me handle, I have this urge to run away. Either that or my body wants to literally fight if I can’t get away. It’s awful. And I feel too stupid and unintelligent to find a conclusion, a clear answer to provide that makes logical sense to calm her down! And for goodness sakes I need that to be a successful nurse! I’ve been putting myself down on how terrible I am at handling other human beings toddler tantrums. I feel doomed.

TL;DR I have never been able to handle a rude or angry customer successfully. I always have to pass it along to someone above me within my job. I feel too stupid and unintelligent to ever figure out the right solution to their problems, or how to shift my focus from wanting to run away/fight, to thinking about how to correct the situation. It makes me feel like I won’t ever be competent enough to be a nurse when viewing the flaws that I have when working in a grocery store. I feel doomed and like I won’t ever learn how to defend myself and not turn into a useless piece of garbage.",Non Depression

Example: where are you from? Me: idk who knows really I could be adopted since my parents are so much shorter than I am 

I also joke around constantly without any reason. I am a host at a restaurant and with almost customer I greet, I have a joke answer for everything. Sure they laugh and they go along and we have a good time but I feel like I do it too much. I also do that with the co workers and they don’t joke back and I feel annoying almost

So I have a question about Covid,"So I was thinking the data for countries vary by country because of the % of people  they test. From what I’ve been reading on reddit a lot of places are just not testing people until they’re like really showing severe signs, and even then sometimes they are denied.

So I’ve also read about the amount of testing South Korea has done after the religious group made the virus erupt there.

“A nation of 51 million, South Korea has tested about 250,000 people since its outbreak began on Jan. 20, with a daily capacity of 15,000. It has conducted 3,600 tests per million people compared to five per million in the U.S.”
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free

You could say, look at China they have the most people tested. Yeah, but the whole reason this blew up is because of their lying and lack of care early on, trying to cover it up. So I don’t believe a word China says.

The question is, wouldn’t South Korea be the best place to look at for things like death %?
I ran their data based on what is on worldometer.
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries


When I checked their cases were at 8086 while deaths were at 72.
Ran the math and it came out to be .89% let’s be safe and just round that to 1%.
I know 1% is high but still a lot bette than what other places are showing, 3-4%.

"I’m 18, just lost my first daughter due to stillbirth and don’t know what to do with my body or life. Help? Advice?","I’m 18 and just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. She was born sleeping so obviously I didn’t get to bring her home. I loved being pregnant and I love my baby still, but my lifelong dream is to be a mother and a gardener. I was close to being prepared fully for my baby. She came pretty early at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation (I was 8 months pregnant, basically). Her father was extremely abusive towards me and actually tried to strangle me multiple times. Naturally, I left him when I found out I was pregnant. We rekindled later in the pregnancy, he figured out where I had moved to and came up to “see me”. No matter how many times I said “No, let’s wait, let’s be sure this is a good idea”, he would not listen. He never took my feelings into consideration. He called me crazy for worrying about the things I would worry about (him hurting me after pregnancy). 

I’ve always been very in tune with my body. I know when something is wrong, whether I acknowledge it or not. When I was pregnant, I tried to stay as in tune with my body as I could. I ate as healthy as possible (a cheeseburger here and there never killed anyone), I sat down when I needed to, I napped when I felt I absolutely needed to, I counted kicks and made sure she moved. 

The night before she passed, I had a TON of cramps out of nowhere. Moving around didn’t help, drinking didn’t help, I told her dad I thought I needed to go to the hospital. I might be in labor. I had been very stressed with him and for some reason the whole week I kept saying “i’m going into labor soon. I don’t know when, but soon” no one believed me. He didn’t then. He said I was fine. They eased up after about two hours. I pushed it off as just Braxton Hicks. I had been having them for a while before then, it was way too soon to be in labor, right? That night when I laid down for bed, she was moving, as usual. I overslept and woke up the next day at 3pm. I went pee and noticed... I was spotting. I panicked and called the hospital and they told me I probably just lost my mucus plug, no need to come in, but start getting ready for a baby in the next few weeks. My body hurt and I couldn’t eat. I felt hot and dizzy but didn’t even think to check my temperature. That night by 8 I sat down to count kicks because she wasn’t really moving and I honestly wasn’t paying attention. I waited for an hour but there were none... she usually moved by the first second I would lay down. I knew right then something was definitely not right. I called my sister and told her to take me to the hospital. We went in and at first they didn’t think anything was wrong. They set me up on the monitors and thought they had a heartbeat but it was irregular. It would skip a few beats. They called in for an ultrasound and at one point she turned the monitor away from me, wiped me up, then left the room, didn’t say anything. I looked at my sister and just KNEW there was something definitely wrong. The nurse came in, pulled a chair up, all I could think was, “please just say I have to do a C-Section. I can take that, I’ll take it”. That was not the case. There was never a heartbeat. They caught the placenta, not her. I lost it. I couldn’t believe what they said. I just kept repeating “are you sure? can you check again? you’re positive?”. She told me things like this just happens sometimes. My body went numb. I started dry heaving because I was crying and shaking so badly. They moved me into a labor room. I was dilated 70% and was, in fact, in labor and had been since the night before :) funny, huh?

I sat on the bed, they left to get me a new gown because the IV was leaking out of my arm. All I wanted to do was scream. Instead, I continued to sob and ended up vomiting. I puked so violently I broke my water but I sat there, I thought I just pissed myself. I didn’t give a shit. When they came back and I stood up, there was a puddle of blood and fluid on the bed. I sobbed out, “ What is that? What’s happening to me?” They continued to dress me in the gown and told me my water just broke. I cried even harder. I had to deliver my dead baby, how the fuck was I supposed to do this? I called her dad in because he oddly brought me comfort and I wanted him to be there. If she was alive I wouldn’t have done this, for both of our sakes. 
She came the next day at 1:25 pm. She was gorgeous. The cords weren’t tangled, she came out easy, she was just perfect. They sat her on my chest and I never wanted to let her go. I wanted so bad for her to just burst out screaming but she never did. They washed her and dressed her and wrapped her up and handed her to me and when I situated her in my arms, air came from her lungs, I smiled and thought “she’s going to do it!” but it was just air. Nothing else. The entire time I got to be with her I prayed she would wake up. I didn’t want to accept she was actually gone. But she was. 

Fast forward to now, almost two weeks later. I broke up with the dad for good. And I found out the placenta was infected and that’s probably why she passed. It could be just an infection or Chlamydia, which is funny because I have been with the same sexual partner on and off for well over a year now. He was persistent that I was the one cheating. But the thought of even having sex while I was pregnant felt so wrong and two weeks before she was born I got tested for STDs. I was clear. I slept with him a few times after that and then this happens. I feel so betrayed and so... cheated. Cheated out of everything. I just wanted a baby. I’m considering a sperm donor just because I don’t want the drama of a partner. I don’t want to go through that again. I will strictly stick to sex toys if it means I can be a mother.

I do not appreciate your tune, nor the way you talk to our staff. you need to realize your place and who you are talking to.

Having said that 
1. We did not promise any online course (YET)
2. In spite of the communication that the regulatory body sends us from Health Canada, which is persisting on not canceling any class or event, we chose to let students decide, as an adult, whether they want to attend classes or not.

3. Delivering a class on a streaming service was JUST a favor. if you did not like the quality, read on your own. Thanks for your suggestion but we certainly are far more capable and experienced than you think and we already purchased the proper tool and we are testing it. Bear in mind that we are NOT an on-demand supermarket to order whatever you wish, any time you wish it.

Telemedicine - is it going to be big in the future?,"Hi wonderful people of Reddit - 

With the rising COVID-19 pandemic, it’s becoming more and more apparent that certain health and medical practices may need to be overhauled or restructured in the future such that we are better equipped to face emergencies. One of the biggest issues, especially in America, is insufficient access o care - especially in rural areas.

Telemedicine/telehealth applications have been around for some time and seem to be growing in popularity. r/AskReddit - do you see telemedicine as becoming more widely used in the future? Why or why not?

Do you have any experience using telehealth in any form now? There are a variety of apps available including Curology, MDLive, Dr. On Demand, and the Ro Health triad - Roman (for men), Rory (for women) and Zero (for smoking cessation).

I’m especially curious to know if anyone has had experience using any of the Ro Health apps, which seem to be lesser known, and what their user experience has been like. 

Looking forward to hearing new perspectives! Cheers!",Non Depression

3. Delivering a class on a streaming service was JUST a favor. if you did not like the quality, read on your own. Thanks for your suggestion but we certainly are far more capable and experienced than you think and we already purchased the proper tool and we are testing it. Bear in mind that we are NOT an on-demand supermarket to order whatever you wish, any time you wish it.

What’s wrong with me?,"
I am a 21 year old 6’2 college basketball player and have been told by many women that I’m very handsome. I’m blonde, I’m nice, most people don’t have anything against me, and I’m just a well known and like-able guy in general throughout my community. I am not mean to others. I know this has nothing to do with the title so far, so I’ll get to the point. As I said I’m well known throughout the community, a lot of people know who I am and what I do. So I am not lacking friends or anything, I have the friends I need and nothing less. What I can’t understand is why sometimes when I’m with a group of friends or with a friend that invited other finds that I do not know, I go mute sometimes. When I am only around the select few people that are my “friends”, I am talkative and can easily carry on a normal conversation. But when I get in groups, it’s almost like I have no confidence or I feel like I might be judged by something I say. So I go mute sometimes. When this happens, I feel like people get the idea that I’m mad or just not having a good time or do not like them, but that’s kotd it at all. Even if they are friends of my friend and I do like them, I might not talk much because I don’t now them very well. And it’s not just that I’m quiet, it’s that I really go into mute mode and don’t say a word. People may think I don’t like them when this happens, but really it’s just that I don’t feel comfortable to talk or only feel the need to say something when it needs to be said. Everyone tells me I’m quiet. Not at first, but as they get to know me they eventually tell me I’m a quiet, low-key person, and I don’t know what to think of this. Is it a good thing. Bad thing. I don’t know. I know I need to work on my socialization skills, but I don’t know where to start. Most people would just assume I’m a normal dude that’s not socially awkward or anything. I wouldn’t say I’m socially awkward, I just literally do not talk if I don’t feel the need. I can talk with girls fine, random people fine, but it seems that when I get with a group, my confidence is shot and i don’t know why.

Boyfriend and best friend dislike each other ... a lot,"Some context before I launch into everything: my best friend and I have been friends for a little over a year now. My boyfriend and I have been friends five years and are going on six months dating. He’s also been one of my best friends these past couple years.

When my bf and I first started dating he and my friend (who lets call Kate) actually talked and got along. Sure it was kinda awkward but they texted sometimes and talked irl, etc etc. So it was all ok. But then I think Kate started to get jealous and she already has a strong personality, but then this jealousy made it over the top. She makes snarky comments, belittles him and me, will yank me away when she sees we are holding hands— the works. My bf (who we will call David) has no tolerance for that sort of attitude, and now it’s turned into a vicious cycle of them making nasty comments to each other and just ignoring each other. 

The problem is they both want to be around me, and all three of us have the same classes. It has come to the point where class is hard to manage bc the tension is awful. And David even mentioned how he’s considered just going and sitting with other people and not showing up for lunch anymore just to escape it. I totally get that— he seems absolutely miserable and it makes me feel bad bc I feel like I’m keeping him in a situation that I know he hates. So I told him that he really should just do that bc seeing him that way pains me and he doesn’t deserve to feel that way. And then maybe that way Kate will cool off too and won’t feel the need to make the comments she does. 

Ideally, I want them to at least tell each other where they stand in the hopes that SOMETHING can be resolved. Overall this situation makes me so sad and anxious and idk what to do about it. I feel like messenger between them and the reason that two people are so unhappy. Does anybody have any advice as to how I can approach this? Should I ask them to talk it out? Should I say something to Kate? Any help would be appreciated  x",Non Depression

"Dear Redditors, when has a teacher made you say, I hate you? REPOST","Here is my story! (Yay!)

So it’s 6th grade, I’ll call this teacher ST (Stupid Teacher) 

Some backstory: My brother (my twin) has been in the hospital due to sickness, I’ve been on calls with my mom and taking care of my little brother, so homework would be done at around 11pm at the earliest. I had to go to school to pick up my brother’s homework. So, I would go to school sleep deprived and depressed. And this is where the story starts.....

It’s the beginning of math class which is 2nd Period (for me, that was at 8:40-9:20, really early.) I was exhausted and my friends recall me at a point having dark circles. Anyway, I tell ST that I didn’t finish the last problem completely and then asked if I could finish it while she’s going over the homework. ST says no, and I’m not very surprised with this answer. (She had been saying that for days on end now.)

Skip ahead to when ST starts to go over the homework, she very loudly states as a reminder(and I remember this because of how much embarrassment and sadness I had at the time) that we need to FINISH our work to get full credit. As ST is saying all of this, she has been looking at me. Then she says this: “Kraken is a great example of this! She didn’t completely finish her homework like she should have!” 

At this point, I feel absolutely terrible as my classmates know what’s going on with my brother. She then gives the homework back to everyone and gives me a 50 on it. I ask ST if I can explain myself because she hasn’t gotten the hint yet. 

I tell ST about my brother and she tells me that I should be focusing more on my homework than my brother who was two days from dying of sepsis. I then recall breaking down as I walk into my ELA class for third period. 

(You thought it was over? I wish.) 

My homeroom teacher (we’ll call her FT for favorite teacher) noticed this and walked next door to see if anything had happened. They talked for a while and I still don’t know what she said to this day.

FT told my class that we would be doing this reading worksheet and that we would be working in groups. In my group was BFF (u know that already) and AK (annoying kid). AK would make me constantly uncomfortable and to this day he still does. Anyway, they’re reading and I’m really quiet (because I’m still in shock) and AK yells at me, “Can you read? Or do you miss your dead brother?” One, he isn’t dead and he’s perfectly fine a year later, and two, yes. I do miss him. 

BFF tells him to be quiet and we get on with our class. After class, BFF told me that AK was spoken to and that FT was handling everything that happened.

Secrets to ask a friend,?,Non Depression
When has a teacher made you go “I hate you”?,"Here is my story! (Yay!)

So it’s 6th grade, I’ll call this teacher ST (Stupid Teacher) 

Some backstory: My brother (my twin) has been in the hospital due to sickness, I’ve been on calls with my mom and taking care of my little brother, so homework would be done at around 11pm at the earliest. I had to go to school to pick up my brother’s homework. So, I would go to school sleep deprived and depressed. And this is where the story starts.....

It’s the beginning of math class which is 2nd Period (for me, that was at 8:40-9:20, really early.) I was exhausted and my friends recall me at a point having dark circles. Anyway, I tell ST that I didn’t finish the last problem completely and then asked if I could finish it while she’s going over the homework. ST says no, and I’m not very surprised with this answer. (She had been saying that for days on end now.)

Skip ahead to when ST starts to go over the homework, she very loudly states as a reminder(and I remember this because of how much embarrassment and sadness I had at the time) that we need to FINISH our work to get full credit. As ST is saying all of this, she has been looking at me. Then she says this: “Kraken is a great example of this! She didn’t completely finish her homework like she should have!” 

At this point, I feel absolutely terrible as my classmates know what’s going on with my brother. She then gives the homework back to everyone and gives me a 50 on it. I ask ST if I can explain myself because she hasn’t gotten the hint yet. 

I tell ST about my brother and she tells me that I should be focusing more on my homework than my brother who was two days from dying of sepsis. I then recall breaking down as I walk into my ELA class for third period. 

(You thought it was over? I wish.) 

My homeroom teacher (we’ll call her FT for favorite teacher) noticed this and walked next door to see if anything had happened. They talked for a while and I still don’t know what she said to this day.

FT told my class that we would be doing this reading worksheet and that we would be working in groups. In my group was BFF (u know that already) and AK (annoying kid). AK would make me constantly uncomfortable and to this day he still does. Anyway, they’re reading and I’m really quiet (because I’m still in shock) and AK yells at me, “Can you read? Or do you miss your dead brother?” One, he isn’t dead and he’s perfectly fine a year later, and two, yes. I do miss him. 

BFF tells him to be quiet and we get on with our class. After class, BFF told me that AK was spoken to and that FT was handling everything that happened.

So yeah, first post on r/AskReddit!",Non Depression

People who have experienced sleep paralysis; what is you NOT scary experience? (Serious/NOT SCARY replies only),"Every time I have had sleep paralysis it has been terrifying, but not in the sense that there’s a demon that’s scary and creepy and trying to get me.

My visual hallucinations are fuzzy but it’s always the same couple of things. It’s all either:

1) Four people, a small girl with high energy running around excited “showing off what she can do” by sending tingles down my arms and legs, a teenage boy she calls her brother falling her around and laughing with her, and two elderly people sitting in the background watching over them like parents. 

2) Just a voice telling me “Everything’s ok. You’re safe. Yes, we’re real. We’re real, don’t worry. You’re safe..” Which is creepy but it’s never said in a tone that is intended to scare me, it’s calming and comforting.

26F Struggling to overcome co-dependency with friends &amp; family.,"26F I have struggled with co-dependency since middle school. I would always have at least one friend out of my friend group that I gravitated towards more than the others. I don’t know why, but we’d just click and I would have feelings of wanting to always hang out with them, jealousy when they hung out with others, envy when they got into relationships. It’s gotten a little better since being an adult but now I’m experiencing those co-dependent feelings again. 

I have formed a close bond with one of my cousins and have lived with her since moving to a new city. After a few years she will he moving out soon because she’s ready to live alone. Completely understandable, but I’m feeling super anxious and sad about it. I fear that once this happens our bond will diminish. That’ll be forgotten about if I’m not around everyday. I even question if I can feel comfortable living alone again. Has anyone else struggled with this? What would you do to ease all the fears? Thanks!",Non Depression

"Redditors that are High School Dropouts/have GED, what difference did it make in your life and what advice do you have for high school kids?","My son is 16 and has major depression and has been diagnosed bipolar type 2.  I’m trying to help him. He hates the system of school so much and I can’t say I blame him at all. I want him to stick it out and finish—two more years of school. He’s is pre-AP English and AP History, but we dropped him to regular algebra and chemistry because of his absence when he had to go to the hospital with depression. He’s extremely good at writing and analysis. He is a fast reader but doesn’t read for fun because, you guessed it ... school. He makes music. He produces his own beats, adjusts them and what not, and writes his own lyrics, records and he’s on all the music platforms now to get exposure. He wants a career in music and film. He is in Advanced Theater and his art work for art class just qualified for State in Texas. 

I don’t want him to drop out. I offered him an out by telling him look, if you hate this place so much, I’ll see if I can do an at home/online school for you. He hates that idea too. I don’t know what to do! He says he’s given up on education. He doesn’t talk to his dad. His dad would blame me for all of this. My son told me if he lived with his dad he’d have already killed him self by now.

Six Degrees of Separation,"So i was thinking about this theory today and I realised (whether its correct or not) that the theory has to be true. If the average person knows about 600 people (said so on google so it must be right, do not contest me) then each of the 600 people you know, knows another 600 people. You do this 6 times (Cause of the 6 degrees of separation) and you have a rough understanding of the potential amount of people who are connected through just 6 connections. Well to find that out you could just do 600^6 which gives you 4.6656x10^16 which is over 4.6 trillion. So of course the six degrees of separation will work on a population of around 8 billion, because the population is smaller than 6^600. The only way this theory wouldn’t work is if the population was larger than 4.6 trillion- which first of all I doubt would fit on earth and plus Idk if the math is even correct.

I got caught with weed in a military bag. Can you give me advice on how to pass this period and surpass my sober thoughts?,So my parents smelled my car which I smoked a few puffs in it 3 days ago and were suspicious of Marijuana. They questioned me and searched my staff and found about 2g in my military bag. I've been smoking pot because it helps the mandetory military pass by easier and faster as I have only 5 months left. It also helps me edit and I get more work done with it. I work on visual effects and animation and trying to learn new shit sober by yourself when you're out the army is a test of patience. With weed I have patience and I actually enjoy my long ass editing sessions. They got my car keys and visa so I cannot go out the house after coming back from the army. They also send me to a psychologist which I absolutely hated because she prescribed me zannax and I couldn't believe it. Their initial reaction was very bad and they were saying that they don't wanna support my uni education in London which starts in 5 months. That was just a temporary reaction though. It seems everything will be fine as long as I don't use it in their house. My plan is to just use alcohol and maybe some nicotine to fuffil my need of euphoria and less stress since I can't go out with friends and I even told them that. I just feel hopeless at the moment because I feel prisoned 247. I'll sober up for the next 5 months and continue use in London as the police is not concerned about pot there. Also my parents would not complain as much if it was legal in fact my mom told me I can move to San Fran when I grow up and smoke it but not as long as it is legal. Can you just give me some advice about how to feel better in the army without going out at all and having no weed.

Advice on what to do with my sister [18],"This morning her friend messaged me on facebook telling me that my sister is warning them about her being suicidal upon concern. I was honestly not surprised because she said the same in front of my parents and me. Honestly she’s really the spoiled type of kid you won’t ever want to be with—she gets everything she wants upon requests, treats my parents and my baby sister [7] shitty, and even has the nerves to steal money from my parents at times. 
I discussed  this to her friend and she agreed that she is indeed toxic and spoilled. Her friends stopped seeing her after she left the groupchat they have. 
She said she felt like a really entitled kid, expecting her friends to sympathize with her when she feels down whenever my parents scolds her for doing stuff she shouldn’t such as failing classes (tuition is really expensive and she goes to an exclusive school), being really really lazy, and even physically and verbally abusing our 7 years old sister. Her friend told me that my sister was telling them she was abused by an ex and uses that statement as an excuse to everything calling it “emotional trauma”  as I asked her friend to elaborate my sister’s so called trauma, I realized how familiar it is given that she used MY EXPERIENCE and lied straight to her friends faces. Recalling my own experience hers. One time she even blackmailed an ex  of her to buy her some expensive makeup then mailed the thing with my name on it—my parents who received the parcel was shocked because it had my name on it and the sender was another guy they thought I was seeing other guys while i’m engaged.
She’s becoming more and more toxic just to make things favorable for her and my parents only knew the tip of the iceberg—they only know that she dislikes my baby sis and is really rude at times. They are not aware of how toxic and manipulative she is. I feel like they should know so they can take actions on it. 
If I ratted her out, chances are my parents will think I favor her friends over her and at the same time will be mad at me for covering up that she had a boyfriend. (we live in Asia so it’s a big deal) and also our relationship as sisters will be more scarred.",Non Depression

Am i at fault ?,"Hey guys. i want to ask everyone’s opinion about an incident  i am still shaken up about. I was driving into work this morning and the first 10 min of my drive is single lane going both ways and the speed limit is 40mph. There are a lot of residential streets off of this central road and therefore lots of people turning onto this road while you’re traveling down it.

It has a lot of hills and a lot of residential street roads directly over the hills that you can’t really see until you’re over the hill. It can be kind of tricky in the mornings when everyone is trying to get to work and pulling off and on this road. Traffic is frequently bad but this morning there were almost no cars and traffic was very light. 

I JUST came over this somewhat blind hill that has a residential street just over the top of it that you cannot see till you crest the hill. Someone pulls out in front of me from a residential street just as I’m coming over the hill. Maybe 60’-75’ infront of me but I’m traveling about 44mph and he JUST pulled out so I’m coming up on him pretty quickly. Whatever, this always happens on this road. i press the brakes rather hard to slow down. Everything is fine. Plenty of distance. BUT, there was a car behind him turning out of the same road who pulls out maybe a second or two later without barely stopping at that stop sign or looking to see if anyone was coming. This person is pulling out EXTREMELY close to me and causes me to slam on the brakes and i get very very close to the back of their car bc I’m basically going from at speed to 10mph over the course of 1 second. The woman rolls her window down and gives me the finger. I’m now coming off of her to a safe distance after nearly running into the back of her. she slams on the brakes to brake check me after the entire incident. I have no where to go, i have to swerve into the oncoming traffic lane just to avoid going into her back seat (if people were coming i would have just hit her). She kinda moves off to the right so I’m not totally in the oncoming traffic lane after realizing what’s going on. 

She follows me the rest of the way because now I’m infront of her. She proceeds to take a pic of my license plate as i do hers. But I’m shaken up, i was shaking the rest of the way to work because i feel like i almost got into a pretty bad accident. I didn’t yell at her, scream, flip her off, was very calm the whole time but don’t feel good about what happened at all. 

All of this happened over the course of like 15-20 seconds. 

What’re your thoughts on this incident?",Non Depression
Why would I self isolate?,"I have an honest question that worries me and I'm not trying to be mean.  If I am told to isolate for 2 weeks, that's two weeks pay I don't get.  If I don't get paid I can't pay rent and get either evicted, which now makes it impossible to isolate and makes me homeless.  I might be able to make a car payment but me and my cat and my stuff can't live in my car.  Also since I'm now evicted, I have that on my record making it impossible to find another apt that's not in the ghetto.  Also, I'm a student who goes to a prestigious school with a 4.0 double majoring in cell bio and chemical engineering.  My degree is set such that if I had to drop my classes this semester, it would prolong my degree by a full year due to certain classes only being available certain semesters.  Also I would lose my scholarship making it impossible for me to afford next semester making me have to drop out, potentially ruining my life and ending my aspirations and career goals.  I talked to my University and they told me that's what would happen unless a percentage of the student body became sick forcing them to shut down.  It would actually be advantageous to me, if I get sick, to not tell anyone and try to purposely infect as many people as possible in my school.  This would shut the school down.  The best possible outcome for me, if the virus spreads here, is that as many people get sick as possible in my area shutting down banks, my apt complex, my school, and work.  I think the apt would have a hard time legally and financially evicting everyone.  I just can't see a reason, personally why self isolation or even going to the Dr would benefit me.  Also, I did get very sick 2 weeks ago and the drs refused to test me, so there's that.  I was actually told to go to work and school if I feel better.  There have been 80 suspected cases in my area, but doctors are refusing to test making this seem like not a big deal if everyone gets sick anyway.",Non Depression

"He’s never orgasmed with me, stopped trying to have sex, and is sexting other women","I’ve been dating a guy for about 6 months now. Our first date, we had amazing for hours and discussed sex a lot. There was definitely sexual chemistry there. The first time we were drinking, so I didn’t think anything of him not coming. He has never  come with me, or in front of me!

Anyways, fast forward to about 1-2 months after we started dating- sex and any form of it just died down. This was to the point where he would ignore my sexual advances through text, ignore nudes, literally turn over while I’m blowing him, etc. We started having sex maybe once a month and most of those times have been a two minute session where he loses his erection after or is “tired.”  We’ve talked about the sex issues and I keep telling him... he needs to try to work on it, but he has just shut it out of his life.

Also, I have met his family and friends. He calls me his girlfriend, but we aren’t exclusive. I saw him on tinder through my friend’s tinder, and was surprised he was still on there. He ended up telling me it was because he was bored and he wants to take things further with me so he’ll delete it. I told him I can’t and won’t deal with other women, and he assured me that won’t be an issue.

Presently, it has come to my attention that he has been talking to women. I immediately ended things. This led to him saying he doesn’t want things to end and needs a few days to think through things and speak to his new therapist. We had an explosive fight and he said the talking has been ‘sexting women’ to get off since he can’t get off with me. He has told me that he has such a huge mental block and a muddled view of me after not being able to come. He doesn’t know if he is sexual attracted to me, or maybe friendzone concerns?? He also is frustrated because sex is important to him, and he has stuck around because everything else is great. 

I know it sounds like something I should have given up on a long time ago, but I’ve never felt like this with a man before. Everything is perfect, but the sex thing has just been a huge issue and seeped into more than just the sex area. I have given him the final I am willing to still stick around but you have to TRY. I do feel like if he tried- first mentally then physically.. our sex would be amazing and he would orgasm eventually. He said some honest and harsh things today about sex and me, and about committing to me. Now he is going to talk to his new therapist about this and see what sort of resolution he can come with. We are down to: is he going to try or not. 

Also, even though we don’t have sex.. he will randomly finger me, but even that is starting to piss me off. I wish he would go down on me but hasn’t in over 2 months. He said he’s been lazy and he will next time he sees me, but still hasn’t.  My sex life has never been like this with past relationships. So, I am at a loss, feeling neglected, sexually rejected, and not good enough. 

Do you think hope is lost? Do you think he can ever come with me if he tries to work on it? Is there any point in trying since we are perfect other than sex? Please help me!",Non Depression
Should we pay my stepson an allowance when he rarely helps out around the house?,"My partner’s 14 year old son has recently come to live with us. He was removed from his mother’s care by child protection due to emotional abuse, psychological abuse and social isolation and we are working through all of that plus some issues such as gaming addiction, school refusal, social awkwardness and a lot of learned helplessness. He has been through a lot of change moving to a new area, leaving his mum, starting at a new school, making new friends and so on but so far he is coping well. 

When we used to see my stepson every second weekend a few years ago we had a job system where he would get paid $3 for each job. We did ask that he do 1 job a day (Fri - Sun) so that he learned to contribute to the household. He was always a bit lazy and we would have to nag him to do his jobs. Since he’s come to live with us we have kept the same job system ($5 a job now) but without the requirement to do 1 job a day as there were bigger issues to focus on such as getting him to go to/stay in school without the added stress of nagging him to do jobs. If he needed to buy something he could do jobs.

He is still very lazy so he never makes his bed, cleans his room or anything like that unless he’s desperate for cash. We have problems getting him to do basic things like have a shower (he’ll stand under the shower but won’t use soap or shampoo unless we tell him to) and brush his teeth. We’ve recently bought him some kittens as he used to have pets at his mother’s house and he loves animals, but we have to nag him to help feed them or change their litter (when we talked to him about getting the kittens he agreed that he would help out with these things).

He is not good with money either, he spends it as soon as he gets it. When he wants money it’s usually at least $20 so that’s 4 jobs. He’s too lazy to do 4 jobs in one go and gives up after 1 or 2 and then starts begging for an advance (which we say no to, been burnt before when he conveniently forgets and we have to nag). We’ve suggested he do 1 job a day and he’ll have $35 at the end of the week but he doesn’t want to hear it.
 
We also have an achievement system in place for school. Last term we gave him monthly rewards for attendance (he was doing half days) and a big reward at the end of term and he made it through the term without missing a single day. The rewards are either a gift, an experience (eg: escape room) or cash and range from $30 - $50 for monthly and up to $200 for the end of term rewards. This term the achievements are for doing full days at school and he got $50 last week for his first monthly achievement. He has also asked for an advance on achievements which we say no to.

Now he’s demanding we pay him an allowance without him having to do any jobs at all. We don’t think this is reasonable given his reluctance to even look after himself properly let  alone do anything that benefits others. We need to be firm with him just to get him to grow up a bit and not be so helpless but we also worry that we are being too hard given all the issues he’s had.

How can I permanently get rid of my oral thrush (candida),"I’ve been stuck with oral thrush for over a year. I got it initially from using metronidazole for a cdiff infection. I’m only 20 years old and before I had a relatively healthy immune system. Since then I’ve been feeling foggy headed, severe allergies, bloating and almost flu like symptoms. I’ve tried 6 different antifungal medications, none of them worked. I’ve tried fuconozole multiple times and other mouthwash/lozenges. I was treated for it for the first 6 months by my ENT doctor but he told me I need to see my primary doctor because he can’t figure it out. My primary doctor refuses to believe that the white stuff is thrush because “it’s not bleeding” and there’s “not enough white stuff”, I told her that I see white candida spots/ strings in my feces regularly and she told me to see my gastrologist. My gastrologist didn’t acknowledge the candida fungus and instead had me tested for worms. Every doctor seems to be in doubt except for my ENT he knows for a fact that it’s thrush based on my symptoms and because he’s seen the growth himself. I’ve tried pretty much every known suppliment you can buy at the store. Rescently I’ve  had the best luck with oregano oil, lavander oil, garlic, and multivitamins. I also rinse my mouth with coconut oil and saltwater regularly which works really good. No matter what I do it still comes back. I’ve tried candida diets but I need carbs or my immune system get worse and thrush stays the same. If anyone has an answer to this on what I should do I would highly appreciate.",Non Depression

Political Views. Should you care if it has no effect on you.,"Before i begin, i am not sure if this is the correct place to post this, if it is not, please help me re-direct this post. 

Now, everyone has their own political ideology., for example, some people are pro gay marriage, other people are against gay marriage.
Whatever your view is, that's your choice.

So, lets say you are not a homosexual, should you really care about whether gay marriage is allowed or not?

This is not a post to discuss regarding gay marriage, just used that as an example to discuss on whether an individual should care about certain political ideologies if it has no effect on them, regardless on their belief of being a pro or against.",Non Depression

"help me find a lost memory, please?","so there’s a cartoon that i feel like i remember watching as a child, but i have never been able to find out the name of it and it’s kinda starting to drive me crazy so here i am. 

i don’t remember too many details about the show, but this is what i can remember 

1. it had a creepier, darker vibe to it, but could’ve been because of the stop motion style of the show, which leads to

2. it could’ve just been the animation style, but if i can remember correctly, it was clay stop motion

3. each episode was broken down into segments and set up like an interactive game show, kinda. just doing things like answering trivia questions. 

4. the detail that confuses me the most, cause i’m so sure of it, there was a segment, with a Jamaican fish in a fish bowl. i don’t know what game was played in this segment, but i can just remember the fish in the bowl, so vividly. 

that’s all i remember until something sparks another memory, but i know i will know that it’s the show if i ever see it, i just don’t know if i’ll ever get to see it.",Non Depression

How do I calculate how much I should be paid for developing a web app,"I want to develop a website for a cinema in Maputo (called Lusomundo), where a user can find all the information relevant to a particular movie all in one place.

As of right now, everytime they have a new movie, the only information they release (on their Facebook page) are the locations, date, and time of the movie showing. Reservations are made by calling one of their establishments and talking to a real person, which means only one reservation can be made at a time. To find how much the ticket costs, you have to personally go to one of the establishments and ask, or search through hundreds of comments on one of their posts to find out.

I can design the whole website (both front-end and back-end), and I was thinking of using a web hosting service like AWS or Firebase. 

What I want to know is, how much should I be paid for designing and maintaining the website over the years, or how do I calculate it?",Non Depression

AITA for not working things out,"So a little over two years ago I was a single mom of two going through school. My ex of 10+years had cheated on me. Lots of anger and gaslighting and lies on his part. We tried to work things out, but he cheated again and we parted ways. He had a lot of issues after but that’s a different story. 

I started to do things for me again and in that I met my now boyfriend (well I guess ex boyfriend). We started out just flirting when I would come shop at his store, then as casual (but amazing) sex. And between that and talking to each other literally every day, we became best friends with real feelings and started what at the time was a great relationship. We were happy, never argued, loved the same things, hung out with great friends, it was perfect.

Except that he never wanted to admit to people at work that we were dating. We were just friends or roommates. He wouldn’t go onto social media and post things with us or anything like that. The reason always being he wanted to keep things private because having people in his business before had caused issues in other relationships. So I was just patient, didn’t want to rush him. He was choosing me and my kids so I thought I should be understanding too. That and I know his background, he had a hard childhood and I understand him being scared of letting people in and relationship things. 

Fast forward a bit and we really don’t have sex anymore. Which is ok but it was something that changed. He was being kind of off at times but I chalked it up to work stress. Then one day he was gone and had left his old phone lying around. I look and there’s all these messages to and from other girls, explicit stuff, flirting, him meeting them etc. One of them was even someone I knew and was acquaintances with. I confronted him and he denied it up and down, said he was hacked, that that’s why he needed a new phone, that he loved me and would prove to me it wasn’t him and I gave him the chance. 

Things never really recovered. It was about every month I would find something. Whether Facebook, phone, whatever. Just constantly finding messages to other people, one had a dick pic that I know was his shorts, underwear, blanket. One woman, who was fucking married, even acting like she was about to have his baby? Always the same excuse from him, that he was hacked it wasn’t him, he wouldn’t do that. I don’t know why I stayed as long as I did. Because I was so doubtful but it honestly didn’t line up with how he was at home. He cares for me, the kids, it didn’t make sense. We still didn’t have sex but we kept arguing so of course we didn’t feel up to it. 

Over a year and a half in and we tried to just reset. Things felt so good, we were happy and doing family stuff. But on a whim I looked and he’d been texting the pregnant chick. I looked at his phone and there were naked pictures of her WHILE PREGNANT. And I was ready to be done but I got so scared that I was wrong and he was telling the truth. That nothing happened and he had kept them to show her husband. 

Again. Idk wth is wrong with me other than being scared to hurt people and make my kids sad and being alone. Because typing this it’s pretty glaringly obvious that I was a naive idiot. 

So anyway. That was in November. Fast forward to now and I haven’t really seen anything. I did find snapchat on his phone once with messages to someone completely new but he denies it. Up and down that snapchat was ever on his phone. 
Deleted it so whatever. 

Well now. After I decided to just stop giving a fuck about any of it because hey, he’s here and he helps me so it can’t be that bad and if I find anything then that’s that. But even without finding things shit has been bad. We’re best friends but still arguing about things. He’s always irritated and angry. Reading into little things. I bring up the things that bother me and that I want to try to fix and he brushes it off. 

Now I’m ready to be done and we argued the other day, and it ended with me telling him I wanted to break up and him leaving in the middle of the night. He came back wanting to talk about things, and I felt bad because it’s freezing so ok. Tells me to please just let him work on things, let him be the man I fell in love with again, let him prove to me I can trust him. 

I was tired and felt so shitty I figured we could try. But by now I’ve at least messaged a couple of the girls I’d seen messages to. One confirmed that they had sex, the other that he had tried to and at least kept messaging her u til she’d blocked him because she figured we were together. So I tell him he just needs to figure things out and go and that I’m not going to try to fix things with him. We go back to he’s sorry, he’ll do what I asked. He didn’t realize how bad he was treating me but he doesn’t want to lose me. 

Finally he admits to having sex with the one chick but still flat out denies anything with anyone else. Even denies that they had sex more than once when she said about 3 times. Says he never asked for it when I know I saw him text her asking if they could have sex again before she moved. So he’s still not giving me the whole truth. But begging me to work on things with him. Even if I. The end I feel the same way he wants to try and be a better person for me. 

I still said no, every time. Eventually he gets angry and starts yelling, flipped a chair over. He goes on for a bit being upset but calms down fixes the chair. I go to bed and he stays on the couch. 

Typing all of this and thinking about everything I know the right answer. But for some reason I still feel like shit that I won’t work on things, that I won’t get to have my best friend that I thought I had before, and I woke up and still just missed him laying with me. So idk.. AITA? 

Tldr, breaking up with boyfriend who has cheated and still won’t be completely honest, he wants to prove he can be better but I don’t want to work on things. AITA.",Non Depression

I beat up my abusive ex becoming he abuser. I don’t know what to do with myself or what to think.,"TLDR: My ex boyfriend was abusive and I snapped, beating him up becoming the abuser myself.

To start with I am a horrible person, and ashamed of myself and I just selfishly need to get it out somewhere as it’s eating me up. 
I beat my ex up last night. I completely snapped and lost it. I have no idea who I am anymore. 

For some background I realise now he was abusive, and I don’t know why I didn’t realise it, why I justified it or tried to help him become better. But he completely stripped me of my self worth and dignity. He is currently seeing a psychologist for his narcissistic personality disorder. And for the entire relationship I wanted to help him be better and have a healthy relationship. He was selfish, ridiculed my body, picked me apart, told me I’m worthless, other people are better than me, blamed me for his actions, never sincerely apologised, refused to communicate, talked over me constantly and invalidated my feelings, twisted my words, gave me the silent treatment for days, ruined my reputation by lying about me to the people around him especially family who have threatened to hit me and verbally abused me, talked about private matters to others, shown my vulnerable text messages to other people in front of me and laughed making fun of me saying I’m overbearing and crazy, such as when I’ve been having a panic attack and seeking reassurance that I’ll be okay, or after asking him if he wanted me to to grab something for him which he would read and then I would ask “Why aren’t you responding? It says my message was read? Are you busy?” To which I never got responses I still would waste 20 minutes waiting just in case he was busy and did want something. I just ended up not texting him anymore if he didn’t respond because I would come home and he would say he just forgot to respond to me whilst being on his phone, constantly. He lied about everything even to the point of even lying about touching the door that he slammed against me, dumped me and kicked me out of our house after raping me as I wasn’t on the lease.. I begged him to care for me and love me and I chased him. We got back together. And I continued trying to have civil conversations with him about how I feel due to some of his actions. How certain things are mean, hurtful and not okay, ect. He admitted he enjoyed hurting and upsetting me, invalidating me used me as an emotional punching bag and drained me of my emotions and patience on purpose because he felt empty, that he escalates conversations into arguments to be in control. And I stayed, which is definitely entirely my own fault, I did it to myself. I think I deserved it, and I know no one else will ever love me or tolerate my flaws whatsoever. I don’t know why I am this horrible, how I didn’t realise it. 

In the past week he has escalated things. Telling me he hates my skin colour, my hair, my face, my body, I need to wear heavy makeup and dress sexy, that his sisters best friend he has a crush on and always flirts with and stalked on social media is better than me and I should be like that. That I am an option not a choice daily. Purposefully lied about being in love with his ex, and then said it was just to upset me.

I will also add that beside all that a lot of my  built up resentment came from bottled up incidents, the rape and the fact he has thrown hard objects at me, punched me multiple times in the abdomen, shoved me against concrete walls, tackled me and thrown me to the ground countless times in the middle of a conversation that he attempted to escalate to which I kept saying to “stop, please don’t raise your voice and be aggressive towards me,” and followed me when I tried to walk away, left bruises from grabbing me, partially dislocating my finger once which he then squeezed as hard as he could again. I felt my joint pull apart again and somehow by only sheer luck it went back into place. I never hit him before this. He was a judo state champion in his youth, and is currently bodybuilding and 50kg heavier than me, the only self defence I know is boxing and karate from when I was a kid and teenager. 

To the actual act, it was last night. We were going to have sex. Why? I initiated as it’s the only thing that makes me feel cared for or wanted while happening. He wasn’t getting hard and I know he likes porn a lot so I offered to have sex while watching it. We put it on he got hard and he pushed into me without foreplay which I expressed hurt me, then proceeded to have the laptop placed over my breasts and face, he came inside of me within a minute. This is the second time he’s done that but this time about 10 minutes afterwards I asked if he enjoyed it and he told me he would have loved to been fucking her instead, she’s better than me. He takes at least 40 minutes with me doesn’t get hard for me, ect. 

I snapped, it felt like my whole body ran cold and numb and I lunged at him to slap him. He did his usual hip throw and I instantly become completely consumed by rage when he grabbed me, I rolled out of it off the floor and came at him full force, he didn’t do anything but have a guard up at this point and I completely railed on him, forcing through his guard with relentless full weighted fast punches throwing fakes to lower his guard cutting up and bruising both his cheeks, he picked me up and threw me down again trying to hold me in a lock with his entire weight and strength this time with an elbow on my my neck, holding one of my hands, I dug my other hands knuckles into his throat leaving another bruise. He let me go and we stood there for a few seconds I felt immense anger and nothing at the same time. He said “You’re lucky I didn’t smash your teeth in” I yelled “GO ON THEN!” and lunged again, I held onto his the back of his neck with my left hand and elbowed him at least 10 times with my right. I let go roundhouse kicked him in the side of the head and then grabbed him again and kneed him in the stomach and ribs at least 5 times. I don’t know why he didn’t hit me this time like he usually does. 

I completely and utterly attacked him with full intent to hurt him and I do genuinely feel absolutely disgusted in myself, and yet somehow still, like he deserved it even though I certainly know, no one does. And that makes me feel scared of who I’ve become. I know I should be charged with assault and I have no idea what to even feel or think at this point. I used to think I had a strong sense for right and wrong, for justice, I’d never hit anyone hard, I could never bear to hurt anyone while sparring. I would walk away. I clearly don’t though. I know I did something horrible and absolutely, disgustingly, wrong. I feel completely broken and ashamed about what I did, for hurting him, for wanting to, and I should be held accountable for it. Can some please tell me what do I do now? How do I process my heinous actions. Despite the reasons I snapped it was entirely my fault, and my actions that were wrong. I’m lost.",Non Depression

I thought of a travel card or Uber gift card to help out for now, If you have any sweet/cute ideas to help him feel better I would love to hear them!! Thank you",Non Depression

"Help, I am 22 and my dad just died. What do I do with all his debt?","Hello reddit, 

New account for this question. 

2 weeks ago my father had a massive heart attack. Although he was medically insured my family is still afraid of the potential medical bill we might get from the hospital and/or ambulance. Unfortunately we also learned via mail that he had a debt from car loan. However that car was returned to the dealer by him last year after he realized he could not afford that car. Because my father was secretive man my family did not know about this loan and subsequent unpaid debt. My mother is elderly, she is afraid of getting her house repossessed (both her and my father own the house) over the future medical bills and this debt collector letter she received today. What are her options? Our options?

PS My plan was to call the debt collector let him know i want to set up a payment plan to avoid any harm to my mom. Same with the medical bills.",Non Depression

am I really just dumb and selfish?,My stepsister and my stepmom always yell at me over things that I forget to do like household things. My stepsister’s laundry was in the dryer and I moved it into my laundry basket because there was no other basket to put it in. My laundry basket isn’t really a basket but with clear squares in it it doesn’t have any cloth. She then comes into my room and yells at me for being so thoughtless and inconsiderate for moving her laundry into my dirty laundry basket. I didn’t think it would be a big deal because my laundry basket is so big with holes and it doesn’t have any fabric covering it. She said she felt disgusted and how f*cking annoying it was. I said sorry and she just left my room. She then yelled at me more for not coming out and helping her to fold her laundry. It didn’t cross my mind that I had to go help her fold her laundry because of this. This seems all so stupid but this is stuff that I get yelled at for. I always get called thoughtless and dumb and why I don’t think. I really don’t know if it’s because I’m selfish and I only think about myself or if I’m just slow or never was taught,Non Depression

How do you know when it’s over?,"I’ve been with the same guy for over a year and I have a lot of love for him. He’s done so many thoughtless things in our relationship, like many people do but through patience and growth we’ve learned to move pass them. However, I was at my wits end when I saw him checking up on an old crush of his and found out he had looked up other girls too. I broke up with him but a day later he asked me to lunch. We talked made up and two days later I found up he was looking up other girls the day we broke up and he went to the bar but he never did anything with them. No texts or meetups. We worked it out but ever since then I stopped putting the same amount of care that I had before. Yet, if you asked him things are better than they ever have been and they do feel easier and more natural. But that’s probably because I’ve been going out with my friends more and I get a lot of male attention. I went dancing with my friends and she was hooking up with this guy who invited his friends and they basically took care of us the whole night. Kept dragging us away from men who couldn’t take no for an answer. It was unofficial so we went to a party after and I danced with another guy and it was honestly the most fun I’ve had in a long time. Went home to my boyfriend and was passed out for the better half of the morning. He found out I danced with another guy and I was like yeah I did and he was like “well now you know how it feels to make slip ups and I hope you won’t hold me to such a high standard anymore”. And he also said “if our roles were reversed what would you do?” And we both agreed I would of broken up with him, but he didn’t do that. I’m not used to being the one who crosses a line in relationships and even though nothing more than dancing happened, it’s fair for me to say I don’t dance with just anyone. I believe it to be deeply intimate and sensual. The vibes were just there I guess. I guess my point is are we just staying together because it’s comfortable? Why didn’t he break up with me?",Non Depression
Incredibly strange guitar amp problem,"So, I will try to explain this as easily as possible, but it’s an odd situation.

I just sat down to play and plugged my Orange CR60C into the same power strip I always use. My amp would not turn on. So, I plugged into two other spots on the strip, still nothing. I unplugged the strip, tried the amp on both of the plugins directly into the wall outlet, still nothing. I tried it in an entirely different wall outlet in a different room, nothing. BUT, I tried it on a different outlet in the same room as the original power strip, and BOOM, the amp comes on... this makes no sense to me. Also, let me add this, every other device I have will work on the outlets and strip that the amp won’t. Any advice/help is welcome. Please help me out. Is this my amp or the outlets??

Why do “southerners” do that?,"Hi everyone,
I should lead in with saying that we are originally from Germany and live in the US (NC) now for four years. We love it here!

Still, two things that we have a hard time wrapping our head around this are:

1. Everybody always says “let’s do this, that and the other together”, but nobody ever follows up. In case you have something scheduled and one party has to reschedule or cancel, it is always on us to propose a new date. Otherwise we will end up with “let’s get together really soon” and then the whole relationship dies with that. 
2. Recently, I try to sell some of our stuff online on different platforms. I have many people asking questions, but then I do not hear anything ever again. No thanks, but no thanks or anything. I also scheduled to meet with people and they just did not show up and never sent a message.

Am I getting scammed?,"I have a personal google business page where I sell my paintings. About 3 days ago I received an email that a man wanted to buy one of my paintings. The grammar in the email wasn’t great, but his email named said his name was Mario Andreas, so I assumed english may not have been his first language and dismissed it. He said he wanted to get one for his wife for their anniversary and said she liked my work. (Mind you; I’m not a well known artist. You can’t google ‘artist/paintings’ and my page will come up.) I’ve been on the cautionary side, and he hasn’t mentioned anything that was too strange like asking my personal info up to this point. The only thing that really raised a red flag for me is that he said his budget was 2k-5k and my paintings are clearly priced on the site and none go above $200. I’ve been humoring him up to this point and sent him an image of a new painting I just finished that is considerable larger than the others, and told him it was $1000, along with one of my smaller ones that is complete and ready to be sold (for $150). I’m going to paste the last response from him here.

 I just want to know if anyone thinks this is a scam. I obviously would not accept a personal check (cashiers check only); and not send my personal address or cell. (No alteration to grammar or spacing has been made) The last email is as follows:

Thanks for the message,  I must tell you I intend to give my wife a
surprise with the immediate purchase of the piece. Also If you'd like
to know, I'm relocating to the Philippines soon and our wedding
anniversary is fast approaching. So I'm trying to gather some good
stuff to make this event a surprise one. I am buying this (2 images)
for
$1,150 as a gifts to her.I'm okay with the price, I think it's worth
it anyway, so I'll be sending a check.

As regarding shipping, you don't have to worry about that in order not
to leave any clue to my wife for the surprise. as soon as you receive
and cash the check, my shipping agent (who is also moving my personal
effect) will contact you to arrange pick-up.

What do you suspect the charge for this is?,"So my girlfriends brother let’s call him ‘jack’ has been hanging out with this guy, let’s call him ‘Derek’, who has been dealing him ICE. They’ve been smoking it together for months however Derek decided to tell jack what was really happening with him.
Now Derek sells ICE to many people, so he’s got himself a reputation by the locals and the police. He has been in and out of court (he’s getting 100% time in jail) but the system want more evidence so they push back his hearing each time.
The police have resulted in using drones to watch my girlfriend, Jack, and their father. Not only this, they often have people following the truck around the place due to it being jacks car.

Very recently, jack fucked up. Derek was due to be in court and jack was supposed to be there with him to support (jack left earlier than the court time) . But instead of doing as he was supposed to, Derek sent jack a message saying “the second I’m in court they are going to raid my house, can you drop by and clear some shit.
I’ve got bullets under the floorboards under my bed, ICE in the ceiling and pipes in my backyard” and he replied with “yep no issue”
Jack of course drove over (first mistake) only to find that the cops were already there. Upon pulling up, the police asked for his name and he told them and they did the typical “you can’t be here go away” and so he left... around the corner to change his court clothes of which a police car then pulled up behind him, wondering why he’s still there.. they ask to search him because he is acting suspicious.. and he said no, because I’m not getting arrested. 
They then push him to the ground (ripping his clothes) as they patted him down. They searched the car and found a taser that Derek had given jack.
Fast forward. 
The police have dereks phone and know everything about jack. Jack is in some shit, he had to report to the station due to being aggressive woth police and refusing arrest. Jack now has to report to the station 3 days a week for a month before his court hearing.. what do you think is going to happen?",Non Depression

How Can I Be Myself But Be Attractive To Women? Should I change or just be me?,"I’m very self aware that what I like is not what women find attractive At. All.  I’m 22 and want to make a change while I have a chance but still be me and stay happy.

First allow me to say what I do right because people start just assuming all sorts of things about my life when I say what I like lol:  

*Im average looking, average body, good hygiene (not a given for the stereotype of what I like)

*i stay physically active playing basketball

*I dress like an average guy 

*I enjoy cooking Korean and American food because I take pride in my mixed heritage

*I know how to clean and keep a clean apartment

*im studying in field with solid job prospects and decent money 


I say all this because whenever I say what I like people give me a wide berth and people tend to think I’m not worth their time and assume the above is not true.

Here’s where it goes TERRIBLY WRONG WITH GIRLS IVE TALKED TO:

* I like using Xbox to talk to my friends who I moved away from ( I don’t play too many games tbh) 

* I watch hella anime 

* I draw anime characters and album art and post it to my other reddit account.  I enjoy seeing people that like my work on reddit.  It makes my day bright! 

*i enjoy Studying Korean and Japanese (I want an international job one day

* I insist on wearing glasses ( weird but a girl told me I looked awful once with them :(  ) 

I like these things partly because I’m shy, people have made fun of me since I was little for this.  I’m just not a loud person and this seems to be something women don’t like in my experience.  I can talk, I’m just a reserved person I can’t really change that lol

I’ve tried finding other things that are more classically manly things but I just am not happy.
I’ve tried lifting weights, getting into cars, being a “sports” guy but I just end up looking fake because I don’t like these things.

How can I both make myself happy but still seem appealing and not a boring person?  
I don’t want to stop doing these things because a GF won’t make me happy, I only I can do that.  But I really like the idea of having someone in my life that’s closer than a male friends. 

Should I change or have I just not yet found the right woman? 

TLDR:  I’m a painfully average person who’s shy and whose hobbies and likes are women repellent lol How can I change but keep myself happy or should I just keep doing me ?",Non Depression

Chronic Leg Pain // Does anyone know what is wrong with me?? Desperate!,"Hi all,
I’ll try to make this as short as possible. About 2 years ago I got an office job when I was 19. After about 3 weeks I started having a pain in the back of my legs, directly under my buttocks. The pain was in both legs, and felt like a stabbing. A few weeks go by and the pain takes over my lower back near my SI joints.
Wanted help, I went to my doctor. Who sent me to another doctor, who sent me to another doctor, etc.
Since this has started I have different specialists and doctors; general physicians, orthopedics, neurologist, rheumatologist, acupuncturists, chiropractors, physical therapists, pain management and others. A total of 17 different specialists and doctors, and all have told me something different; SI joint disfunction, Piriformis Syndrome, bursitis, sciatica, tight hamstrings and more. 
I have been sent for 5 MRIs and 3 x-rays which all show nothing. I have had 5 steroid injections and facet blocks in my back to stop the pain, but those don’t work anymore either. 
My pain has become unbearable. I have been living off of prescribed pain killers for almost 19 months. I can no longer drive, and I am posting this today as it is hard to walk now. Sitting and driving hurt the most, in the same spot originating in my back and directly under my buttocks. It reaches into my hips, making them feel inflamed and sore as if someone has been hitting me with a baseball bat. 
I am 21 years old and no doctor has been able to tell me what is happening, and I am slowly running out of hope. Please, if anyone has any information that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you.",Non Depression

Today I finally tied my shoes again after my injury. Should I rejoice? Or contemplate???,"
Hi Reddit, This is a long one so i apologize ahead of time. I am kinda in tears rn and can only type with one hand so sorry for the mistakes and grammar errors. So I don’t really want to explain how it happened, because it still gives me nightmares, but nine months ago I had an accident and my right hand (dominant hand) was cut and the laceration caused by it cut my ulnar nerve 100% and my median 70%. It’s hard to talk about but I was rushed to the hospital, bleeding out, asking the guy across from me “am I going to die”? At this Point I can’t tell you how much blood I lost but it was a lot. Anyways he says to me “just calm down because anxiety and your heart racing can pump blood faster in a situation like this”. He tried to call me down by asking me questions and complimenting my tattoo. So I get to the hospital and I’m surrounded by everybody. It feels like everybody in the hospital was surrounding me. So they stitch it up(poorly I might add) but I was done bleeding. Fast forward to seeing my doctor performing surgery on me told me I might never be able to use my hand again 100%. Blunt, but honest which I can respect. So the day I went to the hospital they were checking beforehand to see if I had adequate blood flow to keep my hand. Monitors the whole ordeal. My fiancée heart was pounding and so was mine. But alas they said it was sufficient enough to go through surgery. I was in the operating room for six hours before I woke up on a bed getting attentive care in the post op. The nurse said hi in an angelic voice and the first thing(even though I was certain) was to ask if I still had my hand. I did and I was ecstatic, because I had some hope. After all of that I was prescribed Oxy to deal with the shocks from nerve damage. If you haven’t experienced it it feels like somebody put a taser right on my wrist. I would scream in agony it was horrible. I was in a cast and then in time in a splint which I was in for four months until I took it off. My fingers were bound by straps in a position that locked them in an backwards L shape. I started therapy to try to loosen them up and help my dexterity and mobility in my fingers because they were stuck in the same position for months. Today was a little step that made me cry I finally got the mobility to use my right hand to tie my shoe lace. That is all and off my chest, I’m lucky to be able to even due a minor mistake.

What is the purpose of life?,"What is the purpose of life?

Very vague question that I am pretty sure most everyone has asked a time or two in their life. Seriously though, what is the point? We have had thousands of years to figure out what we are supposed to be doing, yet, all we have to show are some electronic devices we shove our faces into every day, lights that are convenient, knowledge we only know as truth, some nifty transportation devices, medicines, countless theories on everything under the sun, weapons that can kill one person instantaneously,  weapons that can kill millions instantly, and a million other things we use just to make our lives a little easier... a little less... hard. But why? We act like we wake up every day trying to conquer the world( I mean, we do say that right?) but can we? Do we “conquer the world”? We still have heartaches and darkness that encloses us into a box we don’t want another soul to look upon. So how has anything we done improved the human condition? Does it need improving? And if it does is there ever a point that the condition is improved? If all of humanity was seen as one person, how would you describe that person? You start with the birth, the realization that he is “alive”, and then what? What’s next for that person? If we look at it from our point of view, well, the person plays as a kid, learns some in school, works till they’re  almost dead, plays some more (maybe), then, they’re done. So, is that how we are supposed to be? Or do we carry on? Do we just continue trying to “make things better”?... but what is”better”? If a lion, let’s say, were to become “alive” like a human, to be “aware”, do you think that lion would simply just stop being a lion, or would he become... something else? Would he wonder why he was going to kill that antelope that was just running a minute ago, just to feed his body? Would he try and make it so he never had to go kill an antelope again and find “better things to do”? How would the lion deal with the human? Will the lion still be a lion? At what point would he understand, that he’s only a lion?",Non Depression

He’s lied to me about so many things and along with his past and things he’s said and done I don’t feel like I can trust him alone with her and i DEFINITELY don’t trust her without me at the house he’s staying with. Most the people have mental issues, especially his mother, she’s on mental disability and I have screenshots of her saying she prayed for me to miscarry my first child that I actually did miscarry and lying on me and my husband, and the house is infested with roaches and not kept up well. I’ve never kept my daughter from him, when he lived near us I would let him take her to his house despite how young she is because he constantly threatened to get me in legal trouble if I didn’t obey and would manipulate me into believing if I didn’t give him what he wanted social services would get involve and she could get taken. Our relationship has always been toxic and I have a misdemeanor of contempt thanks to him and his brothers provoking me and pressing an assault charge on me for telling them not to touch me or I’d kill them. It was two separate charges, that both got dropped, but because I was on probation for the first one when the second occurred I got arrested and thrown in jail while pregnant for probation violation and out of all of that only got the misdemeanor of contempt. I also had a suicide attempt a year ago after I lost my first child and was dealing with his manipulative narcissistic garbage. I know I’ve made mistakes too but everything wrong I ever did occurred during our relationship and I accredit it to his influence and the stress he put on me. I was perfectly fine before him and I’ve been fine after him other than the stress he continues to cause. I love my baby more than anything and she’s truly made me a better person and I’ve taken care of her since day one and have been told I’m great at it and a natural, even by her father. He also told me he’s been suicidal and took the car that was in my name and lied about making payments and it repossessed. I’m just trying to see if anyone has been through something similar or knows if this is worthy of getting supervised visitation on his part.",Non Depression

SiCk of hurting nice guys! PleAsE help,"I’m 15 years old, I’ve had anxiety attacks my entire life. I’ve talked to/dated a few guys and it always ends the same way.

I can’t sleep or eat and the thought of them makes my stomach turn. After I find out they like me as well, I get nervous and find small things that bother me about them and reasons why I shouldn’t like them. The guy sometimes makes me mad or almost disgusted for little things they do and it’s my fault. 

I want a relationship with this guy and he is the sweetest but I’m terrified the same thing will happen and I’ll end up hurting him as I have before. He asked me to do something today but I had to give an excuse not to go, I was way too nervous and I felt sick.

The death rate is only [3%](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/coronavirus-world-health-organization-announces-mortality-rate-has-jumped-to-3-point-4-percent/). If this rate is even correct, the virus is going to kill ~92M people over the course of sometime. [58M](https://www.indexmundi.com/world/death_rate.html) people already die every year. 

~92M is only twice of total deaths per year. There is 7.7 billion people in the world. 92M is small compared to the world’s population.

This is my first ever post to Reddit so apologies for the title of my post lol.
I've started writing a fantasy/reality story about revenge that then basically becomes a story about the uprising of a villain.
I've made some progress with it, written a few chapter drafts (not in chronological order) and the people I've shown it to in real life have given me great feedback however, I'm trying to find people willing to read it whom will be able to give me an honest non biased opinion.
It's difficult to find as I don't know where to start and I'm excited to write my story so I'm accepting of constructive criticism!
If anyone could offer me any advice I'd be very appreciative of it.
Also my story will involve a lot of fighting, action and sex, so it's definitely not for kids.
The villain is also based off my own personal life so she is also a woman lol.

Let’s play,"Does “let’s play” mean flirting?

I (M32) recently moved to a town where an old college friend (F32) lives. She found out I moved there through Facebook and reconnected suggesting we hangout. 

A bit of context, is that I asked her on a date on college when she, unbeknownst to me, was dating someone. Thereby she turned it down, by saying “you know I am dating so and so..”

Fast forward all these years and we are both in the same city.

So, our initial meeting was frankly nothing short of sparks flying, although I remain unfazed and guarded.  In my mind she was flirting heavily, baby doe eyes, touching me, and laughing. She seemed to not want to leave.

Afterwards she suggested we hangout again when I return (my work keeps me traveling).

So after a couple weeks I reinitiated contacted and suggest we hangout. She said she was thinking about me when I made this contact.

In the context of us arranging general plans she says, she is mostly free next week so “let’s play”. Now that term took me by surprise. I’ve never heard that term used. 

Is she attracted? Maybe I am projecting my wishes on the situation. 


Just a bit guarded from my being turned down by her in the past. But of course would like this to work out.

tl;DR! Woman who reconnected after college, and seems to show signs of flirting says, “let’s play” in regards to us hanging out.

How to make the first move on a girl?,"Now that title is quite misleading in terms of the type of answers I’m after, see immediately after reading that title most of you (if any of you) see this, would assume that I’m the type of idk teen? (I’m 18 so yeh teen) that doesn’t go out much and has never had any kind of romantic or sexual interaction with a girl, which I wanna make clear isn’t the case, but I can see how anyone reading this would see that as exactly the case and I’m trying to convince you that I’m the opposite. So without droning on anymore, I have recently ended things with my girlfriend of two years, we started seeing each other in secondary school and continued through most of college (not the American type of college may I add, I’m from England incase it’s not clear) but we ended on good terms and still see each other almost each weekend as what she labels us as (best friends) which to me is quite demeaning on what I think of it as, but the point I’m trying to make is that she is very popular and one could also say attractive or fit. Now where I’m from that makes her an easy target for all the fuck boys ( again American term for fuck boy I believe is similar to a ‘Stud/ a guy named chad’ ) and basically she bets a lot of attention and I don’t. I made the choice of not ditching my friends for my girlfriend but I decided to go to a more distant college, because in England if you didn’t kno we have these things called sixthform and essentially it’s like staying at your secondary school for another two years accept you’re technically in ‘college’. But I didn’t wanna do that so I went to a college a bit further way that wasn’t a ‘sixthform’ as you can tell I like typing a lot, but again without droning on I essentially ditched my friends and since breaking up with the only person that showed interest in me I am now left without many, is not any friends that I can see often and she gets a lot of attention almost all the time but also goes out a lot more than she used to with me, so I’ve decided today is the day I want to start talking to other girls, I wanna attempt at idk At least finding someone to take my attention off of my ex and start finding the confidence to talk to another girls because I have lost that since being with just one person for two years (which I get isn’t that long compared to others)  but I’m generally a shy person and my original thoughts while typing this is to go straight to Instagram after I post this to accept some requests from girls that tried to follow me ages ago and just send a dm and hope for the best, but I’m wondering if since only joining reddit a day ago, that some of you might have any better advice for me.",Non Depression

Best FREE / BASIC Daw for teaching children? Suggestions?,"Hey Reddit, I've been asked by a local primary school to teach the basics of production and beat making to 11 year olds, and, once they've got it, to work my way down to the younger years.

So, I have Fl Studio, but want to teach them on somthing basic and less intimidating. The more basic the better, as I will also have to familiarise myself with it and will eventually trying to get 7 year olds to be understand it. Any suggestions?

Am I repressing sexual abuse memories?,"Hi everyone, I would love some advice on this as I have no one else to ask really. 

So I haven’t seen the film the Magdalene sisters for years. 
Me and my husband put it on a few months ago and I always thought I remembered a scene where you can see a priests penis. (It’s a film about clerical abuse). 
So I thought going in that I was going to see that scene but there was something in me that was thinking there is no such scene. 

Anyway we watched it the whole way through and the scene never came. I burst into tears because these weird feelings started to creep up. 

The last time I had watched this film was with my grandfather when I was about 8/9. 
The scene I thought I remembered had a penis and black slacks ( which my grandfather always wore ). 

As a young age I masterbated and sometimes in the same room as him (with a cushion between us). 
I honestly just don’t know what to feel. I’m at a complete loss. I loved my grandfather (he died about ten years ago) and don’t know why I have these feelings that something happened because if they didn’t I feel horrible for even thinking it.

Should I accept this presently unfunded PhD position or continue to struggle in the “real world”?,"Hi people of AskReddit! I am facing a life crisis and would like some feedback.

I graduated with a MA in Geography from University of Delaware back in 2018. I had intended on going for a PhD, but for various reasons got sidetracked during my 3rd semester and never applied.

My first job post-graduation was in electrical engineering. This was a six month internship which was lucrative, but I found the work not to my interest. Furthermore, all the employees seemed absolutely miserable in their personal lives due to the job.

I next worked in municipal management for a 6 months in Prince George’s County, but was fired for “inadequate work performance”. AKA, my boss waited 3 months to review a project I was assigned that I had no experience in, and had little time to complete because in that time I had 1) increased tourism by 800% 2) won an international award for my business development 3) managed and renegotiated our trash collection agency because we received on average 100 complaints a month for missed collection 4) teach myself Spanish so that I could be the “carrot” to illegal businesses operating in town before the actual authorities went after them 5) lead a communications effort in town that literally never existed and has since dropped 6) produced and managed the only programs my department produced ... meanwhile the Development Director took 8 hour lunch breaks and my boss took several vacations.

Anyway. After that I (27 M) moved back in with my retired parents in rural Pennsylvania, which I very much appreciate. I struggled to find a meaningful, and even not meaningful, job until last week. In that time, I received a rejection notice from University of Nevada due to lack of funding and an acceptance without funding until “maybe Spring” from University of Hawaii.

My question is, should I take the PhD position at Hawaii? I am not sure if I should risk it for the biscuit and hopefully secure funding through a TAship or some other source in Spring. The program is great and specializes in what I want to do for research/career, but again, it is currently unfunded.

Interracial marriage,"My parents grew up in the south (US) and attended a segregated high school. I never saw them demonstrate any racism until I discovered they are strongly opposed to interracial marriage.

They are now in their 70s and still feel this way.

My dad has heart problems which during this time put him in the hospital several times. My grandma told me i act like his wife because I cooked for him ,kept reminding him to use his fsa for hospital bills ( he legit has $1000 fsa but choose to use credit cards wtf), i would get mad at him when he drinks bc he only does when he has friends around and because his heart condition he is cautioned not to, i also hate being around him when he has multiple women coming around as cheating on my stepmom for the past 20 years has been a problem he would literally bring gfs around me and brother and makes us lie to our stepmom. My brother since losing his job last year has been living with me, he rarley cooks, sleeps all day but manages to eat so much food when hes up, when im home on weekends he often takes my car without permission and i ask him where he is when he doesnt come home, he asks me for $20 everysingle saturday around 11pm. My family has told me i act like his gf because i ask where he is alot, i complain to him about not doing anything around the house and abour getting a job.

Never had a contract with this person. Now he is harassing me and my family.,"Hello everyone. I have been recommended to come here as my brother told me that you guys give tips and advice on certain matters. 

Names are fake to protect the identity of the people involved.

Around summer 2019 I had a friend (Rich) who was helping me try to find some jobs from home as in a creative kind of job like video editing. He gave me contact info to a guy named (Shane). Shane was a really nice guy at first, very professional, has a beautiful outlook on life. After shane and I talked for an hour about what i want to do he then approached me for an offer to join his video editing crew for a YouTube channel he was working on. Kind of like watch mojo type videos, your cliche top 10 stuff. I was very thrilled about this opportunity. At the time I just moved back in with family after graduating college and the breakup of my ex girlfriend, I needed something to distract me and this was perfect. You see, I am a very quick learner and have been around adobe premier since 2004. So Shane was more than willing to offer to pay me money upfront for some videos. So this is when we start to get to the whole point of this ordeal. I did the videos for Shane, as time went on he got passive aggressive because I technically didn’t do it in the “style” like his crew did. But in reality it looked just like the same style, I had friends tell me it looks the same. So a a few months later (october); Shane then calls me up and tells me “so I don’t think the top 10 videos you are making are working out so what I am going to have you do is, mashup videos on Instagram”, I was a bit upset don’t get me wrong because I technically got de-promoted in a sense, I went from making 5-6 min vids to 1 min. So I replied with “that’s fine, no problem at all” I did the mashup videos like he said, gave him what he needed and he seemed happy about it. A month goes by and I approach him with letting me try the top 10 vids, he said that he would give me another chance. So I did it again and he was not satisfied once again, at this point I am irritated, I am literally doing what he wants me to do and I would spend 4-6 hours working on them giving it my all and effort. He then does not text me for 2 months. At that point during that time, I just started a job as a sales coordinator at a hotel which was awesome. Out of nowhere he texts me on New Year’s Eve asking me to do a job in which i was glad to do because I felt as if I owed him and I had no problem doing it. The job was simple get YouTube channels with 1k subs or less and get there email etc. So I spend about 4-5 hours researching my butt off and got around 300-500 channels. I send him the files and what do you know? You guessed it. HE WAS NOT HAPPY ONCE AGAIN. So then after that a week later he texts me and wants thumbnails for his channel, I said yes I would be glad to do it. Welp, what happened was my computer at home literally went out on me and during that time and still currently I am stacked with all of these bills and have no way of buying one. I tell him what happened, he was not pleased with what I said, he then stated “I am the best most patient boss you will ever have, but I think we are done here, I want the full payment that I loaned you back by next week”, by then I just ignored it. Because I did the work he asked me to do for him, part of me told myself to pay him back, but I just thought this was really screwed up and I didn’t know what to do. He texted me 3 weeks after, asking for the money and I said to him that I would try to pay some back but it would take awhile as I got a rent, insurance and the irs (this is so I could avoid some conflict. Yes I know I need to be more stern), He then replies “bullshit, you need to pay me now”. 
As he said that, that is when I started to really let my anger get the best of me as I have been very patient with him and the way he has treated me. I pretty much go off and tell him that he needs to be more respectful etc etc, yes I did swear a lot and went off on him (my mistake). He then proceeds to tell me that I am a thief and I better “watch out” because he will “call my parents, states he has every text message and that (me) i am a nobody and I have nothing, he then also stated he makes a 6 figure salary and that I could never amount to his level. It got ridiculous because not only did I felt insulted I was offended at the fact he was threatening my family and I. My parents are not involved at all they have no part of this ordeal and i did give my parents money for rent that (Shane) sent me. He then states “I will call the cops and bring my lawyer as well if you do not give me a payment”. At that point I felt a bit frightened and did not know what to do. I was advised by family and friends to ignore him and to move on. Well.... that does not work. He has tried calling, emailing etc, I feel harassed at this point. I have anxiety because of this. He does live about 21 hours away from me. But.. this was the breaking point, this is what led to come here. I woke up (I work graveyard) went to my parents house (they were asleep) but saw my brother, he then proceeded to tell that there was a letter or something that was sent by ups or something as they had to take whatever there was back because the person did not knock on the door. He shows me what ups or fedex (sorry I don’t remember carrier, I was a bit heated and forgot) left and it had a note saying to pick it up at the there store, it had (Shane’s) name as well mine saying “to the parents of James”. Yes I was fuming in anger, this guy does not stop, my brother advises me to ignore it and not get the letter and that my parents told him to tell me that. My brother said even if he tried to take me to small claims he would pay more money to take me to court and buy a plane ticket etc. So. 

That is where it ends here. I need advice guys. I am sorry for the long long story. But I needed to give everything significant that happened. I need your help. What should I do?

So, we have an abundance of wild magpies and other birds that have made their homes in my backyard. This day I was particularly upset and was crying outside. I noticed a magpie and it’s baby watching me. I remember thinking, “do they know I’m upset? Surely not.” So I kept my little tantrum up to let off steam. The whole time I noticed the magpie watching me - the baby too. It wasn’t scared or did it seem like it was afraid, it seemed genuinely curious. Almost as though it understood that I was upset. It watched with its head turned (suppose its because their eyes are on the side of its head lol) and just on looked. It seemed so genuinely curious - I just knew it knew I was upset. I felt like it wanted to know why? It was so peculiar to see another animal so genuinely concerned? I don’t know, Probably not. But it seemed so interested in my behaviour. I haven’t really thought about it much until now. However, whenever I go outside I see the mother and it’s baby, and it definitely recognises me. I just know it. Crazy thought, but I wonder if it thinks “it’s her. The one that was upset.” I also wonder if it was trying to comprehend what I was being upset about - obviously two completely different environments and two completely different complex emotional standards. But still. I knew that day that, that magpie could see I was upset and was genuinely curious towards me.

Sarah works at a military office and lea told me Sarah offered to get her new notebooks, pencils, pens whatever she needs before she gets back to uní.

Sarah never offered such thing for me, i was shocked bc all lea had to say was “I’ll use my time here to get school supplies” and Sarah offered to help her out and said don’t buy anything i got you.

Im deeply offended Sarah never offered such thing for me, we meet all the time, she knows im a student as well and she’s never brought me a lousy notebook.
Am i exaggerating? Should i not be offended?
Or am I right for my reaction?

Btw if it matters, Sarah just texted me asking if i wanna go to the mall",Non Depression

Are there any traditional sports versions of snaking in Mario Kart DS?,"Sometimes in video games, players will find a way to exploit a mechanic in an unintended way. The exploit will initially be seen as difficult or rare to pull off, but as player skill increases, it eventually becomes the norm. 

Drifting in Mario Kart gives you a short speed boost. In Mario Kart DS, players found that they can continually chain short drifts together—in some stages, you can do so for the entire race. Eventually, as more players were able to do it, snaking became the normal way to play certain stages.

The other day at work, a customer starting hitting on me. It was obvious I was pretty uncomfortable but he wouldn't back off. When he asked for my number, I felt really bad saying no (I'm working on becoming more assertive and not such a pushover) and just wanted to stop talking to him as quick as possible so I agreed and gave him my number. He was really creepy, and I got a bad vibe off of him. Instead of just giving a fake number or even the more plausible answer to this kind of situation: saying no, I literally handed out my real number... right after i did that, I immediately was regretting it. Besides, I'm in a very committed relationship anyway. I wanted to say no and say that I was in a relationship so badly but the words would NOT come out - hardly any word besides *okay*. I felt too nervous to just refuse to. I have a bit of an anxiety problem, and I have been having panic attacks since that this shady dude is gonna try to stalk me or steal my information.

Under what circumstances can a mother moving her children to another state be considered abduction?,"Please help with any information you have.  Here’s the background:  My brothers ex-fiancé has mental illness.  Borderline Personality Disorder to be exact.  They have two children together and they broke up about a year ago but have remained friends and have co-parented their children somewhat amicably.  Until December when she stopped allowing him to see them.  This day she had texted that she was so high on cocaine that she wasn’t being a good mother.  He went over to help her, he took the kids out of the house for several hours and when he returned she had done more cocaine and was now drunk.  He made the kids dinner and put them to bed.  She asked to speak to him in private and he complied.  He slept in his 4 year olds room.  When he woke up he left at about 6 am.  At 9 am she texted him accusing him of sexual assault.  She has a track record of accusing many other men of this.  She has not allowed him to see the children since then saying that she needed some time to “heal” and continuously moving dates that he could have the kids so that now it has been three months.  When I spoke to him he told me some very concerning things about injuries requiring trips to the hospital, but she doesn’t believe in taking the kids to Dr’s.  For instance she super glued a chin laceration at home when a child needed stitches.  He is getting so many concerned messages from the things she is posting on Facebook.  She has left drugs out within reach of the kids.  We can called CPS but so far have gotten no results.  After I call for a well check we both received emails with threats of retaliation.  One day later his neighbor texted him that she was moving out of her house with no notice.  She stated she was staying in Nevada but then the next day began posting she was now a resident of Southern California.  We called CPS the minute the neighbor said they were moving but no one to the house until a day later and now of course they are gone.  We have contacted two lawyers but now that she is out of state we don’t know what else we can do.  They do not have a custody agreement.  If we can find her via private investigator what should we do?  Any help would be so greatly appreciated.",Non Depression

"If you had the chance to ""download"" a dream, would you want to?","So im just asking because I've been having the strangest, weirdest and most randomest dreams, For the past few years pretty much everyday, it's not like they really affect me in my daily life, but they do make me think. If I'm a good or bad person, they can really mess with my mind so much so I get into a feeling of derealization.

I sadly, (like most of us) forget them when I try to remember them, but others will stay with me forever. May it be a nightmare, happy dream, memory, wet dream or just some random story.

There are plenty of dreams I can remember and could even draw or write but they are mostly ""fractured"" and when I do try remembering them I get a feeling of Déjà vu or even get the weirdest headaches, paranoia seems kick in and I really don't understand why, is it normal or is there actually something wrong with me.

So all I'm saying is if the possibility was there to actually watch your dream as a movie whenever you wanted, how would it affect our subconscious is it healthy, should it be done, can there be side effects?

Just curious and wondering if anyone thinks the same way I do. I have not gone to a therapist/psychologist because I'm afraid of what they will say. It's not like my childhood was perfect but it wasn't bad either, random acts of bullying, depression....

It seems as a pattern that the human race has the capability to grow at an exponential rate, but there’s always something that comes in and poses a set back.

3 days to find out my starting date at new job??,"So, I joined reddit simply to ask this one specific question without asking people in my personal life. Anyways, so my situation goes like this: I recently had an interview on Thursday, they hired me on the spot. The HR lady and front of house manager initially asked me if I could go in on Saturday to start training but then switched it to today. I didn’t get a time on when she wanted me to go in and start training because I forgot and figured I would ask at orientation the next day (Friday). I did orientation and at the end, the HR lady ends up talking to someone else who is apart of HR about when us front of house people should go in and start training. She comes back into the room and says that the 3 of us were going to receive an email from our managers (the other 2 got hired at one location and I got hired for a separate one) about when we were going to start and what not. Saturday comes around and I hadn’t received an email. I then waited until Sunday morning to call my location I was hired for and explained the situation. She said that she was going to call the HR lady to hired me and was going to call me back. She never did. So I ended up emailing the HR lady on Sunday around 3/3:30 in the afternoon about what she would like me to do, if she wanted me to still go in today and start training and she didn’t respond until a little after 7 this morning. She asked if I could go in tomorrow and I responded about 30 minutes after she emailed me. I still haven’t received a confirmation on anything. Anyways, so my question is does this mean anything...? As in does it mean I’m officially hired or not?",Non Depression

Does our technology listen to us and then advertise accordingly?,"So, conspiracy theory - I know. But this kinda thing has been happening way too often lately for it to be a coincidence. So many times, I’ve been talking about a product or something we need with my husband and next time I’m on my phone/social media etc, an ad comes up for that exact product.

Just tonight, we were talking about what to do for dinner. My husband suggested kfc and a new deal they have on. 5 minutes later, I go on my phone (insta - don’t hold it against me) and the first ad that pops up is for the exact meal deal we were talking about. I haven’t had KFC advertisements come up before.

Ladies of reddit please answer this question on looks for me.,"This may come across as insensitive because the question is based off of appearance, but I feel as if it is an honest question.

Okay so as most know, when a Guy looks at a Girl. They see how she looks. They see 3 categories for the most part. Face, Boobs and Butt. 

What are the 3 things you as a female look for when you see a man?

2nd question. 

Now that you have your 3 categories personally chosen by yourself. You get to build your Man. 

Rules for questions 

 1. You only get to pick 3 categories. They can be anything you want as long as its appearance based. 

 2. When you build your man you get 20 points to place into each category. Maximum of 10 points, minimum of 1 point. 

 3. Do not criticize anyone for any category they choose. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. 

And the optional 3rd question. Why did you pick the categories you chose?

My fiancé’s son left a bird behind TV and lied by saying the bird had died.,"Hi everyone!
My fiancé bought his 9 year old child a parakeet. 

This morning, the child told me the bird had died and that he had placed him in a bag and had put the bird in the trash. I honestly didn’t ask too many questions since the kid seemed sad. Later in the day I decided to surprise him by taking the kid to get a new bird from the store. On the way back home, the kid asked me ‘what if the other bird didn’t die?’ I didn’t understand his question so I asked him to explain, he repeated ‘what if the bird we had didn’t die and we would have 3 birds now?’ 
I only said, ‘well, I guess we would need a bigger cage’. 

Later in the day, my fiancé got home, we all spent the rest of the day together. To me, the kid seemed perfectly fine and playing video games (the only thing is he didn’t eat much and vomited). To my fiancé, the kid was feeling down. 

In the evening we took the kid back to his mom’s house (since we only have him every other weekend).

About an hour ago, when my fiancé and I were ready to sleep we heard noise in the living room. We went to check and to our surprise, it was the ‘dead bird’ stuck behind the TV on the wall, trying to get out. We immediately rushed to get the bird out and thankfully, she’s now safe. 

My fiancé is furious and said he’ll scold his son and will ground him for what he did. I however, I’m very confused and concerned because a) I’m dissapointed the kid lied to us, and b) I’m concerned that the kid left a scared animal stuck behind the TV and was able to spend his day as usual.

I don’t know what to tell my fiancé. I honestly don’t think his son is a bad kid. But I can’t help but worry about his actions and behavior. Any suggestions, or comments will be greatly appreciate it.

Thank you.",Non Depression

Any Leap day love stories? Can you beat my brothers?,"So my little brother (well not so little 6ft 3 and 26yrs old) has always been best friends with the girl next door. They were born months apart and they were this cute little double act growing up. They have all these weird traditions. My brother has always learnt a silly dance rountine for her birthday which he does before handing over her present. Whenever he gets a new pair of rugby boots she “blesses” them by wearing them around the garden to make the wearer safe in battle. At school despite having lots of other friends they would always have Friday lunch together, just them. They even had walkie talkies and used to talk to each other until they fell asleep or they got confiscated.

Her two older sisters and I have been planning their wedding for as long we can remember. Truth be told so have our mums.

Anyway when they reached 16, I and her sisters started taking sneaky pictures of them, when they were off guard and staring amorously at the other. In retrospect I wish we hadn’t done this because what 16 year old wants their families planning their entire lives out for them? Although we do have a bunch of really sweet but incredibly embarrassing photos. Again when I say I regret doing it the practice of unsolicited interfamily paparazzi continued until finally banned by my dad two years ago. Anyway these two awkward best friends continued avoiding romance through school and eventually left for university. Everyone was gutted when they found different boyfriends and girlfriends but life went on.

Every Christmas and summer they would come home and slot right back into being those two goofy little kids who wanted nothing more from life than the company of the other. They got jobs and are now both successful young professionals making their way in the world. About a year ago my brother’s little friend split up with her boyfriend and moved back in with her parents for a bit. My brother started making any excuse to come home and again they started spending every night playing sports, watching movies, taking the dog for long walks or just messing around.

At this point I should mention that the girl next door and her family are British Chinese. Sadly recently like many people of her ethnicity she has had some upsetting trips on British public transport where racist idiots moved away from her fearing catching Coronavirus. She wanted to show my brother how awful people can be so yesterday she turned up at our door mischievously wearing a face mask 😷 and after being hugged by our mum about a thousand times, they set off to catch the tube (underground train)together. They were to be on for a few stops and my brother was instructed to stand separately and watch. Sure enough a minority of people started avoiding her and even changing carriage.

Seeing this happen was too much for my brother and he burst out crying. Seeing him crying at her “experiment” she ripped off her face mask and gave him a kiss to say “i’m ok”. Anyway she kisses him all the time but just on the forehead or cheek and it is normally accompanied by a slap on the bottom or punch in the arm. But yesterday it was a peck on the lips and the peck turned into a snog. They continued kissing for several missed stops and by the time they had left the station my brother had told her that he had always loved her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. God knows how the terrified racists must have viewed these remarkable scenes.

The family grapevine has been in overdrive ever since. I have had to calm my mum down on several occasions.

I’m just so happy that they have finally got together and I think they will make each other happy for the rest of their lives.

Everyone have a lovely day and don’t put off telling your special someone you care about them!

Mental Health in Schools - USA,"The mental health training in schools is an absolute joke. They recently tried to address the growing issues by making us watch videos on mental disorders twice a week for a month. It didn’t help. 

At my school we’ve lost 6 students in the last 2 1/2 years to suicide. We’ve lost 2 in the last two months. I lost a friend last week. 

She told me she was going to commit suicide Monday morning. She wasn’t here the next day. The kicker is that my friends and our reported her 9 times. 9 times in a span of two months. Two times the safe line was called. One time we were hung up on. The other time we were yelled at. A series of emails that resulted from our administration were all dead end. 

One of my friends sent another email to admin on Monday essentially explaining that the situation got more intense. She was given the response, “We’ve already talked to her.” That was it. 

Naturally, that raises the question what are schools expected to do? If we are injured at school, legally all the school nurse can do is give us ice, call our parents, or let us lie down for a while. It’s messed up. So if they can do anything for physical injuries, does that translate to mental injuries as well? 

That raises another question. What can change? Things like the baker act are absolutely terrifying and don’t do much to solve the problems. 

What does everyone else think about this? I feel stuck. I don’t understand why the system is the way it is, but I want to change it.",Non Depression

I honestly do not want to break up with them or lose them and I get so sad and hurt thinking about life with out them.

"As an American, if I contracted COVID-19 would I be required to pay for the necessary quarantine and medical treatment, or would I get billed for all of it?","I feel like US culture tries to ignore sickness as much as possible because of the costs of being sick.

So I guess maybe I have a couple questions: are medical services for the novel coronavirus free in the US? how much worse is this outbreak going to be because of the cost of being sick and the culture around it?

Question for those with/without photographic memory,"I am curious because I have absolutely NO photographic memory: What’s it like? What do you see? How vivid are they? Could you hear sounds with it? 

This is my one and ONLY experience with it:
Once, I was up all night and around 3:00, I got really tired and drifted to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later and could see my room around me as if I was awake. The details of my bed and dresser were exact and it was incredible. I realized that my eyes were shut very quickly and began cramming them closed to keep experiencing it but within 30 seconds, like once I realized my eyes were shut and I was still seeing, I saw the picture fading before my eyes before all I saw was the void that I always do. It was so exciting and amazing. This happened a few months ago and It got me thinking about this again. 

My lack of photographic memory does not harm my ability to do well in school. When I remember something It doesn’t ever involve seeing it, it kind of just comes to me when I need it to, just like the words I’m typing on this post. For example, I recently got a 97% on a calculus test. I developed what one could call a small routine and something I learned was if I don’t review for a test, I don’t do well—this applies to easy and hard tests alike. It’s weird, I actually found a music test harder than a calculus test because of this, like the difficulty of a test is based on how much time I put in to recital vs a challenging concept. The concept is a piece of cake no matter what, but remembering how to do it a few days later is not... I forget how to do everything, no matter how easy it is. It will take me a fraction of time to figure out how to do it,but within a week I may as well have never learned it unless I force it into long term memory by reviewing (just like everyone). I learn mostly through my own practice and through a teachers lecture—notes barely help at all unless to note a formula, which is the only thing I need for physics questions and math questions alike. Physics only gets hard when I ovethink it. Thought it would be worth considering because it might be a completely different way of thinking vs people who utilize photographic memory to do school. I find coding to be really easy, but the vocab associated with it to be harder unless I use it myself, then it’s easy. Essentially, It takes me 0 time to understand something but if I don’t spend several days reviewing material, it’s gone. I imagine my short term memory just only stores stuff into long term memory if it is DRILLED.

In vocabulary, I didn’t struggle very much. I could just study for the test an hour beforehand and usually ace it since I’m MUCH better at understanding something than memorizing it. I have to understand it to truly memorize it or have a strong emotion associated with it or some other random factors. I’m not very good with names until they have been drilled into me. I couldn’t describe a face very well either, but I can point out distinct details if I put effort into memorizing a face. I couldn’t tell you what I ate for dinner last night, nor could I tell you the color of my best friends eyes—I could make a guess though and probably be right. In my freshman year of high school, I had to memorize over 300 words and recite it with each word being worth x points. It didn’t go well even with studying. Got nervous and couldn’t focus on recalling memories and later redid it. I think I remember stuff by bridging it to other things, like I could tell you what the second line of the poem was after recalling the first line. I still remember the first few lines of the poem today, in pieces, just by writing this post, around 4-5 years later. 

When I have a blood rush to my head after standing up, whatever you call that term, I do see stuff for a second, but not in my control. I usually see what could be resembled as deep crystal blues, like a deep blue sapphire that emits light over a black void and other things like that.
What I normally see when my eyes are shut is just light hitting my eyelids, aka black void usually or a shifting of the colors red and black and sometimes others depending on what the light of the room is. 
I have sleeping problems and always have. At night, everything changes, but only if I want it to. Sometimes ill be awake and notice I’m shifting into a dream and can dream while awake for a split second before falling asleep entirely. Recently I discovered that when Im trying to go to sleep, I can just pay attention to what object I’m looking at when my eyes are closed and I can eventually pick up on something, such as a point source of a circular dim light trying to draw something but quickly being consumed by darkness before it can get anywhere—its actually beautiful to observe and I fall asleep much quicker doing this. Also, I don’t dream very often. I am a productive person with no trauma. I love science. I’m HORRIBLE at directions, like the worst that I know. I can name the street names that I drive down to get to my house after a long time and it takes me about the same time to get the path down. I drive a lot for work all over cities. Freeway is easier for me since there are exits and I can memorize a path from a freeway exit. I don’t think I have bad memory considering I’ve had people ask if I have it before since I do so well on tests that I study for. 
I also have really bad ADHD


TLDR: My lack of photographic memory hasn’t hurt me in any ways besides navigation and I have my own ways of learning that work pretty well, I can take advantage of the lack of photographic memory to sleep and I don’t dream very often—sometimes months without a dream, but sometimes a week with 3. What’s your experience with photographic memory whether you have it or not. What’s it like for you? Do you have a method of initiating it?

legal help w/ non-traffic citation,"hi, i’m 17m getting charged with harassment in pennsylvania as a non-traffic citation because my father physically abused me and i had marks and i hit him back in self defense and he took my phone and my mother refused to call the police so i drove to work and asked my manager if i should call the police and he saw the marks on my arm and said yes, so we did, i spoke with the police and then ended up just going home and avoiding my father, after he too spoke with the police. i didn’t want to go to court against him and the police asked me if i wanted to and i said no. apparently under pa law, someone had to be charged for the interaction and it was me because “physical discipline is legal towards minors” or something along the lines of that. it was not discipline if i was dragged across the carpet and had marks all over me. how do i fight this ?? pa police are stupid and last time he abused me they said it was just discipline as well, i didn’t fight back that time or ever before this.",Non Depression

"Promised a co-worker a cut of my bonus for completing a job, now he won’t shut up about it.","I never post on here but this has been getting on my last nerve. I was promised a bonus if I completed a construction job on time, from the owner of the company I work for. The second day on the job my helper asked if I would be giving him any of my bonus. Now a little bit about my coworker, he used to be on drugs really bad he genuinely scares me sometimes done a lot of time in jail and has a lot of kids and one of his kids has cancer. He goes to the clinic like weekly and they give him some kinda medicine to help with his old addictions, he will not stop talking when he is on this medication. He also sells these medications, yes even at work. All in all the guy is an okay guy, he just creeps me out because of his past and who he is when he’s on these medications. 

So like I said second day he asks if I would give him some of my bonus. And because of his kid with cancer I said yes and because I have a hard time telling some people no. So we finish the job and still no bonus, my boss hasn’t been paid for the job yet. But my co worker ever single week since the job ended (probably two months ago) 
has texted me asking about this bonus. Every Single Week ... I’ve told him countless times I will text you when I get the bonus stop asking. But still the next week I get a text about this bonus.

How do books readers get attached to the stuff they read?,"I'll be 20 next month and as I think about it, I've come to a realization that there are a lot of issues that I need to address. One of those being my inability to connect to the books. Reading has never been my hobby and I've tried to make it one in the recent times because of my need to get better at English literature to clear out the upcoming entrance exams. So I took up the initiative of reading a novel each week last year. It has been a fun ride thus far, what with all the exciting stories, thrillers, sci-fi, romance genres I've had the privilege of reading. But one thing that has been troubling me since the day one is my inability to truly connect to the content or the characters of whichever book I read. 
I firmly believe that if you are not on the verge of almost crying or really happy according to the story, you're not truly realising or living the art. I feel like I'm betraying this beautiful art that reading is. It's almost like watching a three hour long movie and forgetting everything about it once and for all as soon as you leave the movie hall.

Qué debería hacer? Hay una mujer transgénero y toma la idea equivocada. ¿Qué hago?,"Quiero afirmar que no tengo nada en contra de la comunidad LGTB
Bueno, ayer estaba en coro como un día cualquiera, y en medio del ensayo, como siempre fue, nuestra directora(la llamaré vero para ocultar su privacidad) como siempre ha dicho mencionó al grupo de personas de la nota de contraalto como ""chicas"".
Ante esto una de las mujeres que se considera hombre(lo llamaremos kei), le dijo a vero que trate de usar ""chiques"" o ""les"" porque hay gente transgénero en ese grupo.
Vero afirmó que ya lo hablaron en ensayos pasados(lo cual es verdad), ella dijo que va a ser lo posible para no utilizar los artículos(las, los, les) porque ella no se siente cómoda usando les. Ante esto, kei siguió insistiendo y vero dijo que no y que parece una falta de respeto interrumpir así el ensayo, cuando podían hablarlo en el recreo tranquilamente.
Kei siguió insistiendo y terminó por tomar sus cosas e irse diciendo ""me voy a levantar por el resto de personas que quieren proteger su identidad""(o algo bastante parecido) y cerró la puerta algo fuerte. Ante esto otros/as dos chicos/as transgénero también se levantaron pero solo bajaron las escaleras y se quedaron allí un rato, no enojados/as, si no tristes.
Luego logramos calmarnos, pero kei se fue y no sabemos mucho, solo que publicó en facebook que tratamos a la gente con preferencias diferentes como si fueran basura. Hizo quedar mal a nuestro coro que siempre fue de aceptación y un espacio para olvidar tus problemas. Este coro lleva 30 años, y nunca pasó nada similar. Yo tengo 15 años y todo esto me dejó mal, yo apoyo a la comunidad LGTB, tengo mejores amigos con preferencias diferentes, vero también los apoya, pero siento que kei se pasó y entendió mal que vero no los discrimina, pero no se siente cómoda utilizando el lenguaje inclusivo, no podemos obligar a alguien a ser quien no se siente cómodo.
Kei parece una persona, no mala, pero viendo su vida privada, parece que solo hace lo que hace por atención, parece que esto del lenguaje inclusivo no se da cuenta que él lo toma como moda ciegamente.

Is it ever okay to say the n-word if you were raised saying it?,"So I was thinking about this and I hope I don’t come off offensive. This is a genuine question and I hope I get genuine answers and explanations as to why it’s okay/not okay. I know this is a controversial topic so please be as understanding as possible because I don’t mean any harm. I do not say the n-word and I have never considered saying it. But this isn’t about me. 

Let’s say you knew someone (Let’s call him S) who isn’t black. But S was raised around black people. He was raised in the hood, surrounded by gangs and drugs and affiliates that were in and out prison. His dad was part of a gang growing up, and when S got out of juvie as a young adult, he joined a gang after also. This person was also surrounded by those whom are predominately those of African American descent, not by choice but because these are the neighbors and peers that he was raised around and the streets he grew up in. S is a grown adult now and he still uses the n-word. 

As S got older, people began to tell him he isn’t black, so he shouldn’t say the n-word. S says well this is how he is and he was raised like this. To him, S says it isn’t a matter of his skin color, but rather this is his upbringing. His peers, friends, family, affiliates, neighbors, etc. never found it a problem for him to say the n-word, and they still don’t. He doesn’t say it racially and he doesn’t say it as an insult. He says it as a friendly greeting way. S says the word because to him, it’s molded into him as a sense of belonging and a sense of community because that is solely what he grew up around. This is part of his lingo or slang if you want to call it that. S wonders why is it that all of his life it isn’t a problem towards those who know him, but it’s only a problem to strangers who don’t know him? He also says he has no ill intention of saying it, and he doesn’t ever mean it offensively. He has said it all of his life, why is it a problem to strangers now? 

How do you guys feel about this? Please explain your answers so I can see things into perspective. We all understand the universal rule of the n-word: if you aren’t black don’t say it. But how would you go about explaining that rule to someone who believes their social environment shaped them and molded them to believe they’re allowed to say it? How do you debunk his thought process? Does he get a pass? Why or why not.

TLDR: Is it okay for someone to say the n-word if they were raised around it and their surroundings made them feel okay for saying it?",Non Depression

How to tell if my male coworker likes me,"We met in August, though I was in a abusive relationship he knows about but still he would spend a lot of time with me during our shifts (both sales associates ) we work two days a week together

•any project I’m working on he always always offers to join me and we do projects together at work.
• we always do projects just us or find ourselves talking the entire day away just us two 
•we smile a lot have a lot of awkwardness I’m really shy when I like someone and am unsure how they feel about it
• 3 weeks ago he hugged me before he left and asked me for my Instagram 
• yesterday he added me on fb ( didn’t ask just added) we have 3 mutual friends 
 
( I messaged him on fb just to break the awkwardness ) 
• he said “ we should make time out side of work to hang out “ and I agreed, so this week on our shift we’re going to be making plans I don’t know if I should take this as. A date or just casual friendly hang out 

Signs he doesn’t like me 
• some shifts we don’t really talk, we’ll hang in different friends groups and just have awkward looks 
• he hasn’t interacted with my insta once sense following me even a cute selfie
• he probably wouldn’t have messaged me if I didn’t message him

"Coronavirus question, rant, and precautions?","The number one thing that China ships that people inhale is disposable vapes. What if the juice inside the disposable vapes have some one “ cough “ in the liquid before it’s Injected and sealed and then shipped to the US. A lot of these random cases popping up of high school students getting it, it makes me wonder, did they use a chinese vape and directly inhale the coronavirus into their lungs? 

Maybe I’m crazy but since the US blocked them from traveling here and China seems to hate the US, then wouldn’t it make sense for them to “ ship “ the virus? Kind of like, “ well we have it, so we’re going to fuck you guys over too. See if you like how it feels “ 

I see all the news republicans and democrats fighting over this topic trying to blame one another, how about both shut the fuck up and try to solve this problem.

If you don’t stop your bickering, you dumb fucks are going to all die together. Boomers going boom. Then we can put Joe Rogan in office. 

Anyways, be careful of shipments from China. They would out of spite cough in a box or liquid and send it over here to fuck us over. Political bullshit. Fuck...

I don’t personally, but from watching movies and shows set in the medieval ages, I get the the impression that everyone did.

This implies (to me) that they are and that every one surrounding them are Christians and that there culture is based on Christianity.

I hate school and I’ve always hated school. Senior year of hs rn and I can’t bring myself to do any schoolwork I’m cheating on everything.

I’ve been thinking since the summer of going into the entertainment business. I’ve made tik toks and a YouTube channel but haven’t taken it seriously. I know I’ll eventually succeed in those if I’m given enough time and take it seriously. I love doing that stuff over studying any science or math. I don’t want to be a doctor but the benefits are overwhelming. If I become a doctor yes, I will be miserable, but I’ll have a good, stable income, I’ll have respect from everyone around me, and my life will stay private. Im Arab so my family is half doctors half engineers and respect and pride is like priority #1. I know it’ll feel awkward and I’ll feel inadequate within my family if I go into entertainment. My entertainment career plans are definitely less planned out, which means I won’t have a stable income, I won’t have any respect from friends or family, and I won’t know if I could even keep doing it after a few years; burnout, no jobs, losing hype, etc. after youtube I wanna be a stand up comedian but I also have talk show host and rapper on the list. I know it’s a crazy dream. I know it’s not likely for it to happen. But what did everyone doing those things think. They thought that it’s a crazy dream and unlikely to happen but they still did it. They knew the risks and still went in. I’m too hopeful rn please knock some sense into me or tell me your story.

I’m three days late but negative on PTs. Is there a chance?,"
Context:

Last MP: Jan. 30 - Feb. 3, 2020

Ovulation (acc. to Flo): Feb. 6 - Feb. 14

Expected Period: Feb. 26

&amp;#x200B;

I was raped last February 15. It was supposed to be only a casual makeout with my friend. During foreplay I told him that I can't do penetration because I was not on the pill and we didn't have any protection like condoms. He kept on telling me that to give him a chance and that he wouldn't make any mistakes, still I said no. After foreplay, I gave him an oral. After oral, he proceeded to finger me while still making out but he was slowly taking advantage of me. By this, I mean he was slowly placing his penis inside me. He inserted half of his penis but he didn't thrust. I was so scared that I pushed him away me. It was so quick when he was inside me. Again he didn't thrust. Luckily I managed to push him off. We didn't continue with the penetration because he gave up on me...

&amp;#x200B;

 In the end, he didn't came inside me because he just nudged me to give him a head (still being scared at this time). After this situation, I was so traumatized and scared. I couldn't stop thinking about this feeling being raped by my own friend. I couldn't eat during this day and onwards and I was spacing out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm three days late. I was supposed to have my period February 26. I took pregnancy tests yesterday morning and this morning. Both came negative. I haven't been feeling any pregnancy symptoms yet such as nausea and headaches... My friend said it was most likely I was stressed out because of that traumatizing event and also it was because it was my midterms in school this week..

&amp;#x200B;

Was it too early that I took the pregnancy tests? When can i get for most accurate results? A lot of people say that early and highly sensitive PTs are able to detect after 10 days intimacy.

He says that we are inferring that means they slept together, but that she never admitted to sleeping with him. I think 'in over a year' is just an adjective to 'they hadn't slept together' that reverses the meaning and says they have.

"(Morality) Should a woman always tell a man she is pregnant with his kid, even if he is unwilling and incapable of being involved?","So far this is hypothetical in my case, but...


I might possibly be pregnant with the child of a man that I’m not in contact with. He has expressed he doesn’t want children. He’s also a very shady and untrustworthy guy with a dangerous past, but I’m at the age where I don’t know if I want to get rid of a pregnancy if it did happen. Our paths wouldn’t cross again if it weren’t for something like this, so a part of me doesn’t want to tell him until the child is older. I just feel like it’d be much easier on everyone involved (including him) if he didn’t even know. 


Morally, I feel obligated. Technically, if he isn’t going to keep up on it or ask, I don’t even have to tell him. My guess is that 95% of you will say it’s ethically wrong not to tell him.

"My dad is rapidly losing his mind to brain cancer. He’s heavily medicated, paranoid, confused, has poor short term memory and often has difficulty expressing his thoughts. The more he tries, the more agitated he becomes and we end up talking in circles. What’s the best way to communicate with him?","For context, cliff notes: around June of 2019 my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung and brain cancer. He’s very stoic, doesn’t like to be a bother to anyone, has a very old school way of looking at mental health and tries to be the strong, silent type. He has 3 children that he’s tried to “protect” from this painful revelation and the worse his cancer got (even though we knew, because we can read between the lines), the less he told us. But the brain cancer started to swell, he started experiencing hallucinations, paranoia, wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, and he didn’t tell anyone because he didn’t want anyone to think he was “crazy”. In mid December, in an act that was so outside of his character, our entire community was in mourning... he stabbed and killed my step mother. They had been married for over 30 years. I’m being intentionally vague about specifics for anonymity, but this context is important because dad went from jail, to a hospital, to a secure psychiatric facility that’s more like a hospital. But we can only see him for 30-60 minutes, twice a day (2 hrs per day, max). This adds to his anxiety and frustration because he knows that when he’s trying to explain something to us, he’s on the clock. He’s got to get it out before the nurse comes into our visiting area and tells us it’s time to leave. What ends up happening is, he gets more and more agitated as the timer runs down because of that deadline and we will have sat and wasted our hour with him talking about nonsense.

To give an example, there are about 30 other patients in the facility and he gets a bit of special treatment due to his failing health and genuinely good demeanour, friendliness, reasonableness, etc. He thinks the other patients (“inmates,” he’s been calling them lately) all see this and they’re jealous. He’s worried they might hurt him (they won’t). He thinks the nurses are laughing at him (they’re not). He thinks everyone thinks he’s faking it (no one does). But it’s impossible for us to explain that to him.

I have tried deflecting, I’ve tried redirecting, I’ve tried understanding, I’ve tried having him write it down, I’ve tried to tell him to phone me when we leave and explain it then, nothing works. Last night we sat for well over an hour while he tried in vain to get these thoughts out. At the end, he told us to leave and not come back. I know it’s not him, of course... does anyone have experience with this that can help me expedite his thought process, in order to keep him a little more calm and our visits with him more pleasant?

World Bank launches 'pandemic bond' to tackle major outbreaks
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Bank has launched a “pandemic bond” to support an emergency financing facility intended to release money quickly to fight a major health crisis like the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim delivers his speech during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, China May 14, 2017. REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool
The catastrophe bond, which will pay out depending on the size of the outbreak, its growth rate and the number of countries affected, is the first of its kind for epidemics. It should mean money is disbursed much faster than during West Africa’s Ebola crisis.

Ebola spread across the region in the early months of 2014. Michael Bennett, head of derivatives and structured finance at the World Bank’s capital markets department, said that if the pandemic emergency financing facility (PEF) had existed in 2014, some $100 million could have been mobilised as early as July.

In reality, money did not begin to flow on this scale until three months later, by which time the number of deaths from Ebola had increased tenfold.

“In the end about 11,000 people died in that pandemic and it’s estimated that the cost to the countries most affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierre Leone - was about $2.8 billion,” Bennett said.

The PEF will offer coverage to all countries eligible for financing from the International Development Agency (IDA), the arm of the World Bank dedicated to the world’s poorest countries.

It covers outbreaks of infectious diseases most likely to cause major epidemics, including pandemic influenza strains; coronaviruses, including SARS; filoviruses, which include Ebola and Marburg; plus others such as Crimean Congo fever, Rift Valley fever and Lassa fever.

Bennett said the PEF as a whole would provide more than $500 million of coverage against pandemics over the next five years. This includes today’s $425 million transaction, comprising $320 million raised through the bond market and $105 million through swaps transactions.

The transaction was oversubscribed by 200 percent, attracting interest from dedicated cat bond investors, asset managers, pension funds and endowments, the World Bank said.

For the pandemic bond, the World Bank will pay bondholders a coupon that replicates an insurance premium plus a funding spread, in return for a payout if the bond is triggered.

“If a trigger event occurs, instead of repaying the bond in full, some or all of the principal is transferred to the PEF trust fund,” Bennett said. “So essentially the investors are acting like insurance companies.”

Under the swaps transactions, the swaps counterparty pays out if a trigger event occurs.

“The objective of offering the risk in both forms is that the bonds and swaps appeal to different types of investors, and therefore … we are creating the broadest possible investor pool for this risk,” said Bennett. That helped drive down prices.

A replenishable cash window available from 2018 will provide funding for diseases that may not meet the activation criteria for the bond, whilst future donor commitments may be used to purchase additional coverage from the market.

Munich Re, which helped develop the insurance component of the PEF in conjunction with Swiss Re and catastrophe risk modeller AIR Worldwide, said pandemics were among the most likely uninsured risks to occur.

The annual global cost of moderately severe to severe pandemics is estimated at roughly $570 billion, or 0.7 percent of global income, the World Bank said.

"I feel lost at life, I dont know what to do","Like alot of people, I grew up with childhood trauma, my parents fighting, getting bullied, abuse etc. I have already worked with different coaches and knowledgeable about them, I have underwent emotional training, have done so much meditation, so much “self improvement” and now im at the point of my life where I am letting go of all of it and just facing the truth, that I am a broken person. 

Im 22 and I have recently started a fast food business, It is not doing the best but we have only opened for 3 weeks. I started when I was 17 with trying to make money, trading in the stock market, online advertising, none were very succesful but I learned alot. Today I can say that deep inside I have done all those work because I was/am unhappy with my life, I wanted to make money because I thought money would made me happy but now I know it wont. 

Now I am here and I just dont know what to do with my life, I dont see a point as life seems so painful and full of pain, I see it in my parents, most people I see, everyone is just trying to be happy. And I envy those people who are contended with their lives, who are able to make meaningful relationships and achieve good things with their lives. I dropped out of college because I just couldnt finish it, i failed alot and took a job at the sales industry. I envy those people who are just happy with their lives. 

So what is the point of me living, what is it for? If its just full of pain and misery, even if I try my best to be “succesful” its still sadness inside. I see this in my parents who have made a comfortable life for themselves, but they struggle everyday, broken marriage, unhappy family, I do not want to grow up like them but it seems like that is where I am heading.....",Non Depression

As a beloved fan of fiction, I decided to try my hand at writing. The obvious issue comes with that of assessment. How do you know what you have written is any good.. It feels like a waste to spend time and energy into an idea that is not particularly good, or which the majority of others find that way.
Finding an editor seems simple enough, once the work in complete. What is not so simple however is finding a friend, a confidant, during the writing process to assist you with honest feedback.
For some reason asking your friends feels dishonest, as if you know what they are telling you is an attempt to prevent wounding your pride.

What I propose is a buddy system. An active participant throughout the writing process. You show me your’s, I’ll show you mine. No questions asked. 

Hopefully it will lead to helpful input from both sides and a successful product, possibly making future contacts in the industry from opposite ends of Earth. If not... The brave may not live forever but the cautious do not live at all- so they say.",Non Depression

Preventing Pregnancy (NSFW?),"Hello reddit.

     This post might be a little too TMI so I apologize in advance.

      So my girlfriend and I recently became sexually active with one another. Things are all fine and dandy except for one thing. She can’t take birth control as she has a suspected allergic/negative reaction to pro-estrogen. She’s tried taking many birth controls but she always breaks out into rashes and blisters. I thought this would be fine with me, ya know just wrap it up and we’re good, problem is I can’t keep it up. 

     We’ve tried lots of different condoms to see if anything could help the issues but nothing seems to help. She feels bad cause she thinks that it’s her fault and it’s not, and I feel bad for under preforming. I thought about taking viagra but I have heart issues and I think that would be unsafe on my part so I looked into male birth controls and they all lower your T levels to that of effective castration and the long term side effects are unknown so I also believe that would be an unsafe choice on my part.

     She’s the first person I’ve had to use a condom with because I’ve always dated people that used birth control or had IUD’s and pulled out a good while before ejacing so I’m wondering if it’s just an adjustment period and it’ll be something I can get used to or if I’m screwed out of that part of our sex life till I can’t find something to keep me up.

     What I’m asking is if anyone has any suggestions to birth control/contraceptives that are relatively effective without the use of a condom. She’s open to the idea without using one for the benefit of both of us we just want to be as safe as possible.

TLDR; girlfriend can’t take birth control due to complications and I can’t keep hard with a condom on or take viagra/male enhancements due to heart issues. What should we do?",Non Depression

I'm 24, have two degrees, have worked for many years in the same job and feel so stagnant in life. I have so many ideas of what I want to do, but I guess I've reached a crossroads of complacency and fear of the unknown. For me, as long as I'm paying my bills and surrounding myself with positive people, I'm content. But lately I've been craving so much more. I want to be more than what I am, and more than I ever imagined. Recently, I've been inspired by talking to others to find out what their dreams are, accomplishments they're proud of and where they see themselves in 1, 5, 10 years. It's so easy to fall into a routine and lose motivation, but I find that hearing from others really inspires me and gets the cogs in my head turning.

I'm still not sure where I want to go and how I'm gonna get there, but I'd love to hear about your dreams and aspirations, however big or small. Serious replies are appreciated, but have fun with it and let your inner child out. Astronaut and secret agent replies are totally acceptable. And I hope this thread will get enough responses to maybe inspire and reignite lost fires in anyone else who reads and contributes, and that we as a community can bundle together. This world is tough, we are always comparing and being compared, sometimes it's nice to see we're not that fucked up and our dreams are maybe not so far away. 

Thanks everyone!",Non Depression
To the people of reddit. Have you ever had to threaten someone with violence just so they can stop bothering you.,"Example: in my interior design class in high school, we had to be partnered up during projects. Well one of my partners was a fortnite fan, he would at any time do the default dance just to annoy me. One day after being rude to me he did his dance right in front of me, tired of this mans shit, I proceeded to kick my leg out towards his crotch mod dance move but I stopped it before hit, I soon said if he did that annoying dance again I won’t hold back.

Is it offensive to make my video game characters a different race than I am?,"Ever since I was a child, I thought black skin and hair was the prettiest thing ever. You can do so many things with black hair, beads, braids, Afros. It’s so fun and pretty. And colors look amazing against black skin. It makes everything pop. I love how expressive and cultural it can be.

I am a ghostly pale white girl with straightish brown hair and blue eyes and freckles. I saw this thing on tiktok where you draw yourself how you wish you were, not worrying about being fat, or thin, or tall or short. Completely customizable to how you want to look without social restrictions on beauty. My brain immediately thought i would probably want melanin skin and beads in my hair. I also enjoy making characters in games, where you can change your outfit a lot, have darker skin because I think the clothes look better.

This is coming from a position of pure admiration of the beauty of black characteristics. Is that offensive for a white girl to be doing?

I’ve always been self conscious about my skin colour being a tall dark-skinned man but especially in these situations. It didn’t help that I was wearing all black but that is just my fashion at the moment. I purposely take a wide berth and sometimes make noise or call a friend.

Why House moved forward with impeachment without witness testimonies,"I don’t really care if Trump is impeached or not. In my eyes both parties are corrupt. So hearing these moral arguments from both sides is laughable. It’s like listening to two kids who broke the rules trying condemn each other for breaking the rules. 

I know democrats have been trying to impeach Trump since his inauguration. If he’s guilty he needs to be removed. But investigation after investigation, claim after claim - all leading or pointing to nothing is getting old. God only knows how much this is costing tax payers. This leads to my question. 

Why did the house move forward with impeachment if they weren’t ready or didn’t think the articles would be enough to successfully remove him from office? Why didn’t they get witness testimonies prior and build a case? The articles alone should be enough without witnesses. Is there a legitimate reason why they moved forward so quickly? 

As I currently see it, if he’s not removed it was a waste of time and money and poor preparation from the House. I wouldn’t blame Trump. I’d be upset that he was impeached and not removed. I’d view it as another bs political strategy we are paying for. It’s ridiculous. Why move forward without enough evidence to get it done right?!",Non Depression
Need Advice on How To Deal With a Cunt,"I'm going to write this as a TL;DR in of itself since it would take at least a thousand words to fully explain. That being said, this is anything but an oversimplification. This is just a shorter and less in-depth explanation, and I won't leave anything important out.


So there's this guy in my class, and for the sake of his privacy, I'm going to call him CUNT.

A bit of quick backstory: CUNT and I were in the same class and friend group, and I happened to be dating this girl I'll be calling STACY who was in the friend group. CUNT and I got off on the wrong foot with each other; there is some tension between us. STACY and our other friends were the only reason we hung out together.

STACY dumped me, I did some things I regret* and our friend group basically disbanded and everyone pretty much just went their own ways. 
I was definitely at my lowest, most miserable point I have ever been. 
Surprisingly, besides a super loyal close friend of mine, CUNT was the only one supporting me at that time. 

Of course, this only lasted a few months: CUNT, being a cunt, heard rumours that people didn't like him because he was associated with me, and just stopped hanging out with me.
I asked a few people, even people that did not like me, if they felt this way. They knew we were friends but never 'associated' us together. 
So already these allegations are flimsy, but CUNT was already so far gone it didn't really matter anymore.

Fast forward over a three-month End Of Year break, CUNT had joined a band and had gotten pretty close to the guys in my class.
It was immediately apparent that he had excluded me from hanging out with them.
-He muttered things to people about me in front of me and talked shit behind my back.
-He manipulated others in a way that lead to them thinking of me in a bad way. What I mean by this is that he took his time building up lies about me, one by one, over such a long time.            He literally was willing to spend months SLOWLY tricking others into simply not liking me, and that was what he did.

There was only one time he slipped up and broke his facade.  
This whole time he had never outright said he hated me, but on this occasion, he had let loose. He didn't have an outburst but compared to his sneaky cool-headed behaviour this might as well have been one.
I'm not going to go into detail,  but he basically was talking about kicking me out of the (friend) group in front of me. It was obvious he wanted me to hear it, and it was painstakingly clear my other friends weren't playing along. They were honestly just uninterested and didn't feel any hatred towards me, to they told him to knock it off.
So you can imagine for someone whose plan was going along so smoothly and for him to just be caught red-handed like this, he was clutching at straws trying to make himself look good. He resulted to making fun of my race, and I left for fear of bashing that dumb cunt.

There's more to this, but I feel like I've said enough. Let me know what you guys think and what I should do.

What has been your biggest heartbreak or a painful moment in your life which has shaped you into becoming the person you are today?,"I fell in love with a girl and found myself feeling emotions I never thought was possible. It’s cliche that at a young age you fall in love, and it always ends in heartbreak, but in my case, I was always thinking of growing up and how we would fit into each other’s life’s as we move on and find our careers. I was so crazyyyyy in love and I found myself becoming a better person, a better son and a better brother. This ended abruptly however as the girl I loved ended up meeting someone online which lead to them meeting in person and falling in love. 4 years later and it still hurts like it did back then.. I’ve been falling into a pit of darkness and I’m still stuck. Of course I have a select few friends whom I am extremely grateful for but nothing can actually compete with a significant female presence in your life.

I don’t want stupid amounts of money, fame, lots of friends, materialistic things etc. All I want is to be a good person and I hope one day I do find a significant other and when I do, I promise to love her in every way possible no matter what.

Ex-Smokers - How do you quit the habit?,"Hey all, so I made the transition to vaping about a year ago, but I feel recently I’ve slipped back into normal cigarettes and I hate myself for it. I’m struggling to resist the urge to roll one up, especially as I’ve found since I’ve recently started driving and do frequent motorway journeys after a full day of work, getting slightly tired I feel smoking a normal cigarette really picks me up and keeps me more alert. 

My main issues I have is that I want to pack it all in, but I’m a sucker for a habit. Having breaks at work I tend to smoke, to wake myself up in the morning - coffee and smoke, If I drink moretime I will scab a smoke off someone (lots of smokers around me), I’m also an avid gamer so I tend to chain vape whilst at my desk or go outside for a cheeky smoke..

It really frustrates me because I have the will power of a Nat, and I feel like it’s more the habit that’s stopping me quitting - even some of the things I mentioned above have become second nature? Especially if I’m on my pc, I’ve tried to put it past me but I get edgy like I don’t know what to do with my hands because I don’t have my vape there.... if that makes sense? Infact I would go as far to say it’s more the habit/second nature than it is the nicotine that’s stopping me from quitting smoking!

I’m doing a run in August and I’m starting to do more cardio at the gym but it’s effecting my breathing as you can imagine...

I’ve seen previous smoke-quitting posts on here, but I was seeking some help that could target the habit side of things, so anyone that’s been in a similar situation or can sympathise with where I’m coming from, please shout up and help a brother out!! If anyone needs anymore information or questions, I’m happy to delve further.

I told him I didn't have anxiety or taking steroid or have smoker. He requested a blood test to measure my testosterone level and it was normal. However, he told me its anxiety and prescribed to me 10 pills of Xanax even though I didn't have an anxiety problems. I tried it before sex and it didnt help. I went to see the Dr. and tell him about the results of the Xanax that it didnt work as we expected. Then he  prescribe me a viagra to try, so i took the viagra and tied to have sex, it didnt work like what i expected it just helped a little But not a normal erection regardless the headache it gave me. I went back to the Dr. again to tell him about the situations and he said i will refer you to a urologist. I went to the to see the urologist and he did a urine test and blood test but everything was good with me. He prescribed to me cilices and gave a sample of a sex pill you put in the mouth and let it dissolve. But still they did have the same results as the viagra. I went back to the urologist and he told me i will refer you to one of the best Dr. in the world for ED problems. He sent me to the University of Michigan Hospital in Anarbor. Its 2 hours drive away from me but i hade a hope to fix this problem. I went there and they give something called Rigi scan to measure the blood flow to the peines while a sleep.

However i didt for a week before going to sleep it was bad experience  it bothered me a lot while a sleep. I took  the scanner to the hospital to get the data of the machine, the Dr. told me the scanner show that i have anormal blood flow to the pines even though whenever i wake up at night and adjust the annoying machine and see my pines with half erection.

Question For All Fathers Out There?,"Question For All Fathers Out There?

I’m an expecting father, my wife is due any day.  She is measuring earlier than anticipated and we’ve been advised by our specialist that we need to be prepared for our new baby boy!  

We live in the Chicagoland area, and I also work a full-time job, and was recently asked to take a business trip to Atlanta for training.  This training is routine, as in, they hold these courses monthly.  I advised my regional manager that I would feel more comfortable rescheduling the training, or at least attending in Iowa, so I may at least rent a car to be on my home on a more immediate basis if necessary.  

It was then, escalated to the Vice President of my company, who advised I must attend.  I put my concerns in writing, respectfully as to why I was requesting a different course, and time.  She replied, in order to be a manager within the company, this is mandatory.  Obviously my family relies on my income, so I feel I’m in no place to decline.

I was very disappointed and disheartened, as she didn’t mention my wife, or the reasoning.  I understand that not every company is compassionate or carries a culture of family understanding.  However, I’m wondering, if a woman, who is told that she should anticipate labor at any day, would have been held to this same standard.  

To me, this seems very unprofessional, sexist, and contradictory.  I may not be physically carrying out child, but as a father, I do share the same concerns, and do not expect to be put in a different position than a woman would.  The thought of my wife going into labor on her own is upsetting.  Needless to say, I went.  Because I was told to.  However I’m now viewing this company’s culture and respect for their employees in a completely negative way.

My wife, thank God did not go into labor, and I’m now home.  But I don’t feel I should have ever been put in this position.  Upon my return, I advised that I would not be coming in as my wife was experiencing contractions and it was very probable we would be going to visit labor and delivery, I also advised that I was not feeling well from the trip.  My regional responded, I’m sorry you aren’t feeling well.  Please enter your paid time off for tomorrow.  The rest of the message seemed to be lost, or ignored.  

I’d love to hear some feedback on the topic, and how others would have handled this situation.

"Thinking about dropping out, need advice","Hey guys :/ (18) 
So I’m halfway through my first year in a private institution and it’s pretty much a for profit hellhouse. I was tricked into thinking that it was a good idea. I mean 1 course every 5 weeks. Learn at your own pace. I thought that “wow I can stay at home, work and get a degree.” 

I did not truly know how stupid that decision was until now. For the first couple of course I thought wow this is really easy. No stress, nothing. Then I realized how much it was costing me per class after loans. And how much the program was before loans (55k 😓) I owe the school currently 10k after loans. After just 8 months. 

I know that a lot of people will probably dog on this post but, I’m just not happy. I’m not learning anything towards my degree. They are just milking me with these dumb classes that don’t pertain to anything of interest. The teachers are awful and don’t help with anything and the advisors are just props, that hang out in the back and are not useful. I’m not happy with where I am, I don’t know if this is the degree that I truly want in the long run. 

So the question is, “was dropping out worth it, and how did you plan for the money that you still owed the school.”

"I didn't cheat, but should I tell her?","So I (M) have been with my girlfriend for almost 6 years and we have an amazing relationship, but I'm facing a bit of a moral dilemma.

While she was on holiday abroad, I went to visit a friend in another city and we went out clubbing. One of her flatmates came out with us, obviously we got drunk, and as soon as she got a chance on the dancefloor this girl was all over me. I told her no, I told her I had a girlfriend, but she just kept leaning in, trying to grind on me, etc. 

Then she got a bit upset (she's quite good looking so I guess she's not used to guys saying no?) and headed outside to the smoking area. I couldn't see any of her friends around and I didn't want her to be out there on her own so I followed to make sure she was ok and reassure her that it was nothing personal, I was just taken - and she seemed to be taking it really well until she tried to kiss me AGAIN. At this point I decided to go back inside.

Largely managed to avoid her for the rest of the night, came home the next day, and my girlfriend is coming home tomorrow.

Here's my issue: I didn't do anything wrong, my girlfriend doesn't know this person and I'm probably never going to see her again. Do I tell her, or would it just make her uncomfortable? Is there any benefit to telling her? But on the other hand, am I morally obligated to?

"People who have economics qualifications, is a higher or lower rate of corporation tax better for a country’s economy?","As non economist, personally I think lower because I think the lower rate attracts more business which results in more employment. I often use the example of google and amazon which have European bases in Ireland which have low corporation tax yet other european countries are trying to introduce ‘digital service’ taxes to get money out of them. Therefore, Ireland’s ‘low tax rate’ will give them a lot of money because of the massive taxable revenue. Surely a smaller slice of a large pie is better than no slice of it at all?",Non Depression

Am I a bad person for thinking like this?,"I think my bf is stingy. Like, he is v thrifty on lots of things, and at first i was not impressed by it, but I was like ""fine.""
I am not someone who will just recklessly spend, but i also wont be cheap on things I need and on people I love. Like most ppl anyways. 
But he is just, idk... for Christmas he got me a teddy bear, not even a big one, and it is obviously seen it is cheaply made. I was like ""ok"". I wont give much importance to it, its just materialistic.. But now, next week it's my bday. And he gave me my bday preset early, this weekend. And got me another plush toy, again small one. And some keychain w my name on it. But it's not like a fancy, cool keychain, it's plastic and rubber and really ugly. Like, what am I going to do w that shit?
And it's obvious he didn't spend much, nor really gave a thought into it.
Now I feel bad, i mean, i am not overly materialistic person and all, but this make me feel cheap also. It is not that he has no money either. And i see other guys giving an effort, even my friends really trying to get me a perfect gift or experience. Guys hitting up on me with such crazy ideas that also costs them money and time, and it feels nice... and all and he just gets me first cheapest thing he sees. Makes me feel like most important person in my life thinks I'm that, low maintenance? ... And now i feel bad for thinking like that, like i am a bad person for wanting better gifts?
On the other hand, i always get him something i know he needs or wants, and do not like at the price. I often buy him things just out of blue. And ofc he is happy.
He is otherwise really wonderful to me. But idk, i think that when it comes to showing real effort he just backs off.
Like for Christmas i got him original playboys VIP cosmetics and a bong because he likes to smoke. He couldn't hide that he loves it. For his bday he got a book on astronomy that i made an effort to order because there's no such in Croatia, because he spoke about how he would love to learn astronomy... Now i got him real fancy hat and a scarf, not for any occasion but just for tge sake of it, because he was so cheap to buy himself and wore kids winter set and was too small for him and ugly. And he even commented how what i bought him looks like for real gentlemen. And it wasn't cheap either.
And he gets me cheap plush toys. Small ones, so it's not even cute.
Im not asking for him to pay me stuff and such, but just makes me feel so lame. 
I don't know, It makes me feel bad to even mention it to him.
I also dont want someone to buy me stuff because I said so. It loses its magic tht way...
I understand he may not have an idea on what to gice to me. But how other people do? And there's always classical stuff like flowers and chocolate, night out... Oh, i just noticed he doesn't really take me out either and if he does, it's cheap. While when i take him out i don't look at the price.

Losing my best friend..,"Currently I am in high-school, and in my second last year of it. This is very confusing as there’s so much...

Three years ago I became friends with someone let’s call him Luis. Me and him would talk everyday on Snapchat, instagram etc. We never went a day without   not talking to each-other we were inseparable. We had friends before, we were in a group of 4 say 3 technically. We cut them off due to reasons of them fucking me, and him over. The year during we got rid of them, we spent so much time together. We would even skip classes spend days me and him. Just relaxing and nonstop talking. Even everyone in our school said we weren’t complete with each other. If one of us showed up a missing half would be gone. 

Behind the scenes of our friendship we fought a lot, and the prone reason was how I felt that he didn’t give a shit about me. He would never be able to call me his best friend, it was too “girly” for him, even to me it is but I can still say it. I would usually argue about it because I felt so left out, and thought he didn’t care about me at all. Even though we would still get back together and act like nothing happened the next day. Even during the friendship, it seemed that he never wanted to hangout, he would always say he was busy, no time. We didn’t really hang out unless I made the effort. I just feel like the only reason why we hung out is because I always paid for him, always paid for pizza, subway etc just because I cared about him so much cause he was like a brother to me.

Now fast forward today, it’s now grade 11. We’re in a semester based system, and we ended up having all periods together for semester 1, but now semester 2 we have 3 classes. During this he ended up talking to somebody else, and it was always us hanging out together. The new person I do not click with, and he always is just talking to him the whole time while I feel left out. I don’t even get to talk at all really, and it feels so tiring trying to put myself into the conversation. 

We had an argument the other day, and I told him why do you always want to be with him me and you can never just be alone and chill etc. He says it’s more fun with him talking... I said to him I’m done hanging out I feel left out and everything and I’m not going to force myself into the conversation. He just agreed and didn’t care and said okay.

How do you heal from overwhelming self sabotaging depression? How do people change?,"This is serious, I mean I'm up for some comedic relief but I also want serious advice.

So here's a little backstory and some of my thoughts about it. Also TL;DR warning.-

So beginning of this week, someone I've been dating for 5 years and carrying my child broke up with me. Now, I'm not gonna throw a pity party for myself because I truly did fuck up. Im not gonna beg her to be with me again because I truly need to change, not just for my future child but for myself too. I didn't realize how messed up our relationship have gotten, I didn't realize how toxic I was. The night she left, I did something unforgivable, I didn't hit her or anything like that but I did severely hurt her feelings, which is just as bad. She broke up with me at the beginning of this week and I was broken, I kept rewinding our relationship for the next couple of days trying to figure out what went wrong, where I went wrong. That turned into rewinding my life, remembering the abusive relationship right before this, remembering how abusive my mother was after she became severely addicted to heroin, my first memory is watching my father slam my mother into a wall, the next day he forced my hand on to a hot stove for turning off his Super Nintendo, my mother told me both her and my father's parent were relentlessly abusive, my mom was raped at a very young age and I'm not sure what happened to my father because she didn't talk much about it and he left when I was 5, this disease has been passed down my family like a dark heirloom. In fact now that I think about it, all my siblings have the same issue as me, how mean we can be. Anyways started comparing this abuse to hers and thought I wasn't that bad. But that's not up to me to decide, it's up to the victim.. Maybe what I said wasnt that bad but what about the future? I don't want that for her, I love her too much for that. So I've accepted it, I don't want her to give me another chance because will I really change? Probably not, Im not gonna bounce into another relationship because who does that help? I want to be in my child's life but I need to change. She told me that she didn't want to leave me, that she was scared, hurt and felt broken down but she needed to do this for her. She's right, she did and I can never forgive myself for that. I didnt want her to leave me either, I cried everyday now, I got sleep crying and wake up crying but I know the truth of what needed to be done. Thursday night, fourth day of the breakup, I told everyone i loved them, wrote a letter to my ex and my future child, hugged my best friend and his girlfriend and walked over to a local stream, I cut myself three times to let myself feel pain for what I have done. I was a minute away of slitting my throat because I was afraid of doing this to anybody ever again. But then I stopped, looked at a picture of the first ultrasound, cried, contemplated it some more and thought, who the f--- am I helping? All I would do was cause more pain to even more people by doing this. My siblings would be devastated, my ex? She would be in even more pain, my best friend? I don't how he would deal with it with his own severe depression. I don't need to kill myself, I need to change. 

But how do I really start changing? I mean really change, I got a job hunting on Monday and I'm planning on getting health insurance and going to start counseling. I never want to do this to anybody ever again, definitely not my child. I already love my child to death and I don't even know their gender yet. But I'm afraid, I'm so f------- scared to do this to my child or anybody else. I need serious advice, what do I do? How do I stop this viscious cycle? How do I fix myself?",Non Depression

Help breaking down walls,"I [F20] would consider myself a very emotionless person. I shove any feelings to the deep down or squash them.

Fake friend PLEASE HELP SOMEONE,"So I’ve know my one friend for a few years now, let’s call him (Tommy). When we first met and maybe for a year after that we hung out all the time (almost everyday or everyday) and I really appreciate it but it has come to a point now that after a year we started smoking weed (we didn’t smoke before together only by ourselves for a long time) and let me get this out of the way first. I am an over thinker I have 1 sister and one brother and my brother and me have basically the same problems with our brains except I have really bad desperation and anxiety and I also have chronic mono and also schiz etc, I’ve had friends in the past that turned on me for no reason so fst fwrd back to my friend now after hanging out a lot we don’t really talk to each other when we hang out and he also makes plans to hangout with me or he will text me saying we are gonna hangout today or the next day then he will ignore me or make up excuses to not hangout, I’m in no way a person that will track you but the other day he told me we are hanging out that day and he said about to come scoop never came ignored me 5 hours later he says wya I’m otw and then ignored me again until the next day, then he explained that he had a really bad headache well I told my other friend I’ve know way before them and he was like, oh he’s not even home he’s been at X house all day (X=other friend) well what do you know they were smoking weed all FUCKEN day( idc about weed I mainly want to hangout with a “friend”) I never feel comfortable talking to him about my personal problems anymore because he either always connects it to him and starts a whole different conversation without letting me finish why I feel so FUCKEN tired of the bs and extremely depressed and he’s the only person that actually used to care and listen now he just won’t say anything or say sucks or he will try and connect it to something. SORRY IF THIS WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE

(Note 2) when we do actually hangout now he makes a whole big deal the day before that we are gonna hangout (in a good way) then the next day he picks me up and says “my mom said I can only hangout for an hour or a couple hours or he will be like I can only smoke this blunt( he is 20 and honestly I know his parents very well and they don’t tell him to come do shit ever)then he has to drop me back off at home and then he goes to other friend houses I’ve been to and I’m cool with the people.


(Note 3) he will tell me we will hangout later I have to do something with my parents (let’s say he said it at 3pm) and then he won’t respond to shit until late that night saying he is watching a move with them movies don’t last 7-8 hours,) and most of the time we won’t hangout he will text me at 10-11pm saying sorry my parents didn’t want me leaving)

Does anyone work at Waste Management in Michigan or as a curbside trash collector anywhere in the US? My neighbors are online bitching up a storm about our service and I want some facts before responding.,"Hello, need some info before I lose my shit on my neighbors.  My city’s Nextdoor website has turned into a cesspool of non-stop bitching about everyone (but themselves, of course).   There was thread bitching about how fast the Fed Ex drivers drive through the neighborhoods, and ppl were bitching endlessly about the drivers, when in my opinion the blame should rest equally, if not more, with the Fed Ex company for pushing their drivers so much.  We knew a guy who worked for Fed Ex and he talked a little how they have him timed via GPS, that his timeline was tough to meet without really hauling ass at times, and that dispatch would actually call him if he ran behind.  So seemed to me that my neighbors should be more upset with the company than with men busting their asses trying to keep a job the make a living. 
So...now everybody in town is losing their minds about our garbage collectors driving too quickly and not sitting their empty cans neatly back upright at the curb with the lid tightly in place (some flip lids, some detached lids).  Which makes me wonder, is it more often just laziness and carelessness on the part of the workers (which is the opinion of 99% of commenters), or more a matter of the workers being on such a tight time schedule that meeting all speed limits exactly and gently placing cans back on the ground with the lid tightly closed is pretty much unrealistic while still getting their routes completed in time?
I’m just frustrated with ppl being mad at the little guy all the time without holding employers/corporations to account, but don’t know the specifics on the workload (how many houses per day), so don’t want to comment in the piranha pit without facts, because another thing these ppl DO NOT like is someone that might voice an opinion (even nicely stated) that goes against their circle jerk rant sessions.

He can pick up a phone and use Siri to type his text for him  and he can read at a very very basic level so needs help reading his messages he gets. He needs help with eating ( he can pick up a chip and put it in his mouth but has a lot of trouble trying to use a fork. He is confined to an electric wheelchair. He is mentally mostly all there and can be a great laugh! He struggles with accepting some concepts and is a little immature and full on.He cares very deeply for the people close to him, which is few unfortunately as most people he considers his friends are people that have the 5 minute conversation with him to feel good about themselves for befriending the ‘disabled kid’. He doesn’t quite realise this though and will message these people constantly to hang out and will either get no replies or promises which never come to fruition.
At the moment he is struggling with trying to find purpose in his life. He really wants to do something that will make him important and loved by all, for example he has wanted to be an veterinarian,firefighter, race car driver and unfortunately his physical limitations make these goals very unattainable.

Are commission based jobs worth it vs a box retail store?,"As of right now I’m 22 years of age in FL. I work at a major big block retailer store at just around $15.60 an hour. I work with all types of electronics, from laptops to gaming consoles but mainly focus on TVs and High end Audio. No commission, strictly hourly wage with health care and 401k taken out of my checks bi weekly. I’ve been with this company for around 3 years and have been moving up quite nicely, recently applied for a supervisor position that I have not heard back from yet.

I recently was offered a job around 40 miles away (good hour and a half or so of a drive with traffic) commission based work with spiff on protection of a high 18% total with a base weekly pay of $600. Which is already higher than my current job. But this job is mainly focused on appliances. I have a friend that lives local and drives to this store every day 6 days a week and has been making really decent money. (almost double what I make at my non commission based job.) I’m afraid I wouldn’t enjoy or do well within this environment, but I’m eager to make double the money I’m making now. As I’m wanting to focus on my future and build a life.

My biggest thing is losing my currently “set in stone” job I have for a job I’ve never done before especially commission based, and only focusing on one thing such as appliances.
My worry is I won’t do good in a commission based job and won’t be able to pay my bills, or even set my self behind if some months I’m not doing well. Also this company doesn’t do 401k because of how much $ you can make. Anywhere from 65-120k a year depending on sales.


TLDR; got offered commission + protection spiff based job selling appliances, versus the all around electronic retail based hour salary I work currently. Would be a small increase of bi weekly pay but is an hour and a half drive, which would increase $ of some bills such as gas, etc.. what’s your opinion on commission based jobs? And would they benefit more than a normal company big box store?",Non Depression

It reminded me of my funniest story, which I'll tell below. But I want to hear yours. Funniest / most interesting / wildest / most awkward sexual encounters. They are always entertaining! 

My story.  A long story. 

When I was 19, a young, dumb student I was out one night with friends and we had arranged to go back to a bar that our buddy was working in. He was going to be closing up that night by himself so we were going to back before closing time and drink all night in the pub with him. It's known as a ""lock in"" here. 

Anyway, I pulled a girl that night and she came back with us to the pub. Her and I and 5 of my mates. So we are all drinking in the back lounge of the pub. There's a pool table and juke box and we're all having fun. Things start to get hot and heavy with me and the girl so my mates, being good friends leave us alone in the lounge and move back to front bar. So we block the door and go at it fast and hard right there on the pool table. We were fairly drunk so it was pretty wild. Lots of position changes and theatrics. So after we finish up and get dressed, we head out to the bar, get a drink with the boys and act like nothing happened. 

This is where it gets funny. 

So I'm sitting on one side of the table with a couple of the boys and she's opposite me with her back to the bar. My mate who works there was standing behind the bar looking at me and without flinching he turns on the tv behind the bar.... On the tv is a pool table. It takes me a few seconds to realise that it's a live feed from the security camera in the lounge. All the boys erupt in laughter when they see my face change in realisation that they had all Sat at the bar and watched the whole show start to finish. He turns off the tv before the female lead saw the tv. She had no clue why every single one of them were falling over laughing. I had to get her out of there. So I made some shit excuse and got her outside and into a taxi. I went back inside and I Sat there with 5 of my best Friends and we laughed our asses off. We drank the night away and watched the video back, I gave my directers commentary and they gave their compliments and criticism. (I made sure the video was permanently deleted after). 

It was hands down the funnest night we ever had. (Well it was fun until we left the pub at 9am. Hangover from hell.) cherish nights like that with your mates, because they don't last forever. To be young and dumb again!",Non Depression

But the more I’ve grown up, the more strict my dad gets with me. I’m not allowed to know the garage passcode to get into my own house and I can’t be there alone, all because I went to a friends house without asking. He’s taking me out of the sport I love because I missed practices and he never gives me any freedom. He also makes me put my phone on the counter at 8:00 at night, and if I don’t have it there by 8:00, I’ll get it taken away. Whenever I’m around him he’s always in a bad mood and is yelling at me about something. I try talking to him about how he is and he doesn’t see the problem and somehow turns it around on me. I tell my mom about everything and I’ve started staying at her house more but she can’t support me financially like my dad can. I just need him to let go and give me some freedom for once. It’s too much being stuck in a house with him being crabby and I can’t deal with it anymore. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even want to be around him. Any tips?",Non Depression

Should I intentionally get addicted to xanax?,"I’ve spent a full year focused on getting out of my head, being more present, releasing anger, etc and have made serious efforts to do so i.e. reading/meditation, daily workouts, even moving out, therapist, etc. I used to, very controlled, take a quarter bar of xanax a few times a week. I know how addictive it is.

How do I choose decisions over feelings???,"For instance my children’s father ages 2&amp;3 abandoned us last Wednesday. Instead of going to work he went to another females house while my children and I were at home. The closest store to me is about 40 mins away. I don’t have phone service where I live and he had my vehicle. I wouldn’t of never known he went if he had came back home in time from “work”. It gets later and later. Eventually it’s 3 am. He should of already been home at 7pm. We’ve had problems with this female in the beginning of our relationship. But he choose to run off with her that night. I have my mother pick me up the next day Thursday. Calling all the hospitals and jails. No answer at all. I started messaging him Emergency call me. He finally does call. I told him our son needed to go to the doctor because he did, he was suppose to go yesterday but he had to work. He hang up and says that’s not a emergency. I call furious back asking where’s my car. I message his dad saying if he doesn’t return my vehicle I will be calling the cops. I’m not stupid. He eventually talks to me and says he was hanging out with his people and got drunk. I asked if he hung out with her he says no. Then hangs up on me because he got another call. Calls me back about 30 mins later and says yeah I hung out with her all day. Hangs up again. I’m devastated. Crying and yelling. Not knowing what to do. I go hang out with my friend and smoke, while my children are with my mom. He calls me on the phone and where talking then he says you can ask her what happened and she’s been on the phone with us the whole time. So when they were hanging out he took her son to the doctors even though ours needed to go. He went there to find answers after us being together for 4 years. Then slept in her bed with her. She said they didn’t do anything. 🙄 He basically breaks up with me in the phone. Then hangs up and continues to text me. I stop texting. I tell him that people who care keep texting. Then Friday Valentines Day. I hang out with my children and come back to the house. He later shows up dropping my car off and later eventually comes inside and gets undressed from “work”. We talk and of course my feelings get the best of me. And we’re back together. But whyyyyy",Non Depression

Parent here to a wonderful 8yo, at a juncture, life has been busy with work and family, but relationship with partner is flat. Family as a whole is happy, but I’m not and can’t work out the best way forward.

Currently in my bed writing this post...

1) Saturday 8/2 while I was snowboarding my wallet fell from my pocket somewhere off-piste. I had everything inside along with my annual pass for the resort + cards &amp; id’s
2) 2 hours later while flipsliding on a rail I completely tore my PCL and MCL.
3) I didn’t know this had happened since 13/2 that I got the MRI results. The doc told me I need to get a surgery in 2 months and have a brace on 24/7. I wont be able to snowboard till next winter, and I’ll be able to run and exercise heavily in 5-6 months.  
4) I spent around 1.200$ off my savings for a new board , jacket, pants &amp; boots literally 3 days before this happened.
4) on 14/2 after loosing my wallet, ePayments, a digital wallet like Revolut got suspended due to weak anti-laundering systems. I had 3k USD inside that are now “frozen” until further notice
5) on 16/2 my girlfriend got really sick and I haven’t seen here since then. Today that she felt a bit better her period came as we expected.
6) Today I got sick as well, currently with a fever of 38,5 celsius degrees + a brace keeping my leg straight.

DnD hand written scrolls,"Greetings dnd players of reddit. This is my first post ever. I am a dnd player and an amuture DM. During one one of my sessions I thought it would be a good idea to have a hand written scroll to try and some add some emersion to the role play for my players. Luckily my wife has proficiency with calligraphy and the tools and supplies to help me. I gave her the message needed and she went to work. After showing me it to me and we both agreed it was perfect, we rolled it up and gave it a wax seal (it was coming from the bardic college master to his pupil) and on game night I handed to the player. He was impressed and loved it so much he tried to open it without breaking the wax seal. The rest of the group also loved it. That player who received the scroll is also a more experienced DM for group and enlisted my wife's help to write a scroll for our other campaign and once again the group was thrilled to receive a little prop that added that bit extra to our role play

The question I have for you all, DM's and players alike, is this something that people would like to have in their games?

So to give background - the other night my wife and I were going to have sex, but I noticed that I wasn’t really in the mood. I was able to ‘get it up’ but it wasn’t as hard as it normally is. I ended up not being able to finish. The next day I still had the same issue. 

Being a little freaked out, I went to the doctor and they ran blood tests and took my urine. All came back normal, including T levels.

CrApple brand protest,"Reddit! I have had MacBooks for years, bought an Apple watch, and currently have an iPhone 6. For Christmas I was given air pods.

My phone is four years old and is in great shape physically. Unfortunately I cannot put anything on it; I was told by a Verizon employee that Apple sets their updates to take up more and more space with each update and you cannot do anything about it so you eventually just have to buy a new phone.

My old MacBook crapped out so I bought a new one recently. The battery is horrible! It's like a cheapo version of what I used to have. I've had non stop issues with my air pods shutting off while I'm on the phone with a call. I bought my fiance a series 4 Apple watch for Christmas and it's had glitching since the day it was opened.

All of this makes me never want to buy an Apple product again. The company used to make quality reliable products. Now everything just seems cheaply made and expensive. I feel like people are paying for the brand name only at this point.

This all being said I desperately need a new phone. Has anyone made the switch to non Apple with limited issues?? I heard crApple makes it super hard to switch. Any recommendations on a great phone alternative to the new iPhones?? I just want a quality reliable easy product. All phones are crazy expensive these days, is that so much to ask?",Non Depression

Is this the norm at animal shelters or just towards the breed? (Heartbreaking story),"I will try to make this as easy to understand as possible I’m not really good at expressing my thoughts on text, anyways About a month ago my husband wanted to adopt his dream dog a pitbull, 
We have a three-year-old daughter and an almost 1-year-old yellow lab! We are expanding our family dog wise...we visited 2 shelters, The first time our dog met one of the pitbull’s my husband wanted but she wanted to devour her and I didn’t expect much because this dog had a mom that was very overprotective so I thought it’s because of that relationship it would be hard for them to get along. So we went to another shelter that week and we did not have a dog it was a much bigger facility very clean and nice I think we saw three more pit bulls and the thing is when we were looking at them and they’re a little apartments they had some information about them and it was all good that they were housetrained great with children good with other dogs gentle lovely or just all the school wonderful things and we got excited naturally we would ask to see them personally so we can see if it would be a right fit for us, but lo and behold every single time we would see the dog somebody would come in with background papers and then talk about how horrible and dangerous they were and how they’re not good with kids they’re not good with other dogs I was just standing there with my husband confused are we being falsely advertised or do they discriminate against the spread like what’s going on?? We were just upset because we felt like we were being lied to the one that was on the second strike was the one that really bonded with my daughter the most they were having fun and he kept giving me lip kisses and it broke my heart that we weren’t able to take him I understand that if they are not fit for a home with another dog and kids they should really advertise honestly it’s just not fair to the dog they connected with my daughter and myself and my husband all to be taken back into that box it’s just not right... I even have pictures saved on my phone hoping that they have a happy home you know... as for my husband he had to go to the last plan and it was to buy A puppy pitbull which he did and we are getting her in a couple weeks we are very excited and hopefully this way the dogs grow up together and with my daughter and it will be better for us to mold our dog and train her and make sure that we socialize her with a lot of people and dogs.... but yes I don’t have experience with shelters but my first experience wasn’t great it was just really confusing and sad and I hope it’s not like this everywhere...",Non Depression

Waitresses of American Chinese buffets: What are the hardest parts of your day and what do you wish you could change about it?,"So, I was in a Chinese buffet last night and I noticed all the staff seemed a little stressed.

Some things I already do are 


1. cleaning my table before I leave to make their job just a little easier.


2. If I notice it's busy, I typically order a water along with my drink so the waitress doesn't have to fill my cups up as frequently.

3. I make sure to leave a tip. Even if the waitress didn't do an exceptional job, I still tip.


I understand these are just common courtesy, so what things might I be missing that we, as customers, should try to do in order to help spread the good vibes? Also, as the title asked, I'm curious about what you consider hard about your work day and what you would change?

How do I know when it’s time to euthanize my dog?,"I’m really struggling.  I really love my dog but she is towards the end stages of what we think is valley fever.  Her blood work looks like it, but tests were negative for everything such as cancer AND valley fever.  X rays negative... in short, she’s dying and we don’t entirely know why.

She was only 22 lbs, now she’s 16 lbs and is struggling to move or walk.  For a while I was force feeding her and may have to return to it if she doesn’t eat again.  She hates it so much and doesn’t understand why I’m forcing food down her throat.  I’m really heart broken and I don’t know how to assess when it’s time.

Should I attend my best friends memorial?,"My best friend of many years passed away a couple weeks ago. His memorial is tomorrow morning and I am not sure if my presence there will be met positively.

Some back story
My friend (whom I will refer to as J from here on) and I unfortunately got pretty deep into the drug scene together. We had already both done drugs before we met, but our influence on each other greatly increased this. I am not proud of any of it, but it's the truth. Anyways, we had a pretty bad falling out about a year ago. We recently had started hanging out again because I had reached out to him.
Well about a week into the rekindleing of our friendship, we had decided to pick up some oxy 30s from a friend of ours.
That day J also got his prescription of kolonopin filled. After picking up the 30s, he traded me some of his kpins for a couple more of the 30s that I had, because I had more of them than he did. He dropped me off at home, and that was the last I ever saw him.
I hadn't heard from him for a few days, so jokingly I sent him a message saying, ""you alive""
A few days later right after work I found out he had died in his mom's driveway the previous Sunday, the same night we got the 30s, the same night I gave him a couple extra. He died from mixing alcohol with an overdose of oxy with kpins. Because of this I feel partly responsible for his death and it's been killing me. If I never would have reached back out to him and made him aware of the oxys we could get, maybe he would still be around. Or maybe if I didn't make that trade, he wouldn't have had enough of it to OD. We had been doing the oxys ever since we started hanging out again.

So his memorial is tomorrow, and I am sort of afraid to attend. The day he died, he had accidentally butt dialed me. I overheard his mom tell him, ""you better not come back here all fucked up, you always let OP talk you into stupid shit.""
I also sent him msgs on Facebook saying I regretted trading him the oxys for kpins, because I had less than I thought. Someone in his family (I'm assuming his mom) ended up seeing those msgs after gaining access to his phone after he died, along with my ""you alive"" message. So all of this makes me feel like his mom might majorly blame me for her son dying, and I don't want to cause any drama at the memorial. Do you guys think I should attend? Me and him were extremely close, he lived with my family twice. I can't stop feeling like I am at least partially responsible for his death, and I really just don't know if I will be welcome at his memorial. What do you guys think? Thank you

Today i contacted the live chat and they said ;the driver delivered them to security who then rang the florist back to say perishables could not be left at the office after he supposedly already signed for them? And had no idea who even sent the flowers to have a number to call back... they then said they sent another driver to drive  back to collect the flowers from the office which is obviously bull****.

Should I buy my friend a house?,"On phone, formatting issues.. blah blah. My (38f) friend (52m) of 20 years has type 2 diabetes and has had a stroke. He’s currently on a fixed income with disability and an annuity his dad set up before he passed away. It amounts to about $1100 a month. He lives in Anchorage, AK and has been at the same apartment for his entire adult life (28yrs). The rent is currently $900 for a two bedroom. This is unsustainable without a roommate. He is incredibly set in his ways of having his computer desk over-take the whole living room area which he also basically sleeps at... none of the carpet or paint has been updated and he has had a cat that didn’t often hit the litter box target. I struggle to use the word ‘neckbeard nest’ but it comes to mind. Therefore there is a distinct lack of roommates knocking down the door wanting to live with him. I have great credit (800+) and a 50k down payment ready and able to buy him a very decent condo. He has asked me to help him out by doing this for him. We would set up a long term lease to keep things clean and simple. Buying him this condo would be a win-win as I see it. He’ll cut his rent in half and pay down the mortgage. I help out a friend and create a retirement investment for myself. Here’s the problem Reddit folks: I recently had some mental health trouble that landed me smack dab in the middle of a psych ward (slashed my wrist) and whenever this move gets ‘too real’ for him he screams very hurtful things at me which play mostly on my past and mental health issues. He will hang up on me and proceed to ignore me for a week. I have not raised my voice at him. This has been going on for two months now and I’m at my wits’ end. 

So! My super lovely sort-by-new redditors here it is: Do I grin and bare it knowing he’s just panicked about this huge change and lashing out at me? Do I still buy him a place for his - and my investment portfolio’s - own good because he’s been my friend for 20 years and literally has no where else to go; OR do I fuck right off and spend this investment money elsewhere?

What are your weird eating habits?,"
Emotional eating is something I’ve been struggling with the past couple of months, after a few traumatic events in my life. My weight keeps fluctuating up and down along with my emotions. I’ve never had this problem in my life and all of a sudden it has become something I struggle with everyday. 
Whenever I am sad or stressed, I turn to food for comfort. I feel like I am going to starve, or I get this weird “empty” feeling, if I don’t stuff my face right away, even if I just ate. Then I eat a shitload, feel horrible about it and the cycle continues. But, whenever I am happy, like whenever something really good is happening to me or I have something going on in my life that makes me hopeful, I don’t feel the need to eat. I don’t get hungry, feel the want/need for junk food, or really even think about eating. Whenever I have tried to talk about it with others, they find this pattern of eating strange. Most of my friends/family refrain from eating when they are upset and eat a lot when they are happy. 
I was just wondering if anyone can relate to this weird pattern of eating or what, if any, your emotional eating habits are? And if anyone can relate, how do you cope with it?

"GF is overweight, and wants to lose weight. She's made progress before but is more recently very busy to focus on weight loss.","She's a very active girl, not just during her work but also due to her addiction with Scouts.  Initially when we met I was quite amazed she had put on some pounds considering all the activity she does, and having joined her for some of it, it ain't no joke.  I'm a healthy male perfect smack in the middle of the BMI scale, although sedentary, I was running out of breath before she was during some scout activities.  Goes to show I should be focusing on my own health too, not just worrying about hers.

She's active, smart and has already made progress before during her previous weight loss attempts.  I've promised to be of help but my dumb ass gets concerned every time she skips a meal or worries about being hungry and suggest her to nourish herself (bad habits I got passed on from my parents).  Whenever she probed me on the subject of her weight I've told her the truth - I love her the way she is, she's an angel in my eyes, but I do concern myself for her health, and I hold the belief that carrying extra weight around isn't healthy - she agrees and ain't a child, knows her situation well.  I've told her she's beautiful many times, but I don't think she believes me, even though I ain't lying, I think her weight affects her self esteem quite a bit.

The problem I reckon, stems from the fact her family cooks delicious food.  Back home we prepared meals made from haphazard ingredients stored incorrectly and then cooked to oblivion.  They taste... edible, as I spent my early life thinking that's all that food was.  Over at hers they're cooking the food for the gods themselves.  Even Zeus got a gut when he paid them a visit from another dimension.  Her mother is an amazing cook and a friendly, helpful person, but she's also severely obese (probably three times her daughter's size) and is already showing clear signs of mobility issues when she's not even through her 50s.

I'm confessing with you Reddit... I'm worried. I worry she'll end up in the same state as her mom.  If she does she won't be as active as she is now, she might even give up on most scout activities, she might want to stay inside.  Her self esteem would drop even further, wouldn't wanna keep going out.  I know she'll get bummed out, and I have no idea how to tell her any of this or help her without hurting her and insulting her mom.  Nevermind I'm perfectly ok telling the rest of the world on the internet... But when it comes to spoken words I'm too straightforward and a dumbass at keeping calm and not letting my excited ideas shoot out like bullets which get spat right back into my face.

If anything - what do you all reckon I should do?  Oh and I should mention, she may as well become a whale, I ain't leaving her.  That's never on the table.  I also don't wanna hurt her in any permanent way.  If I'm the one that pays a price that's no biggie, I just want her healthy and happy.  We're soon moving into our own house, I want her to be the mother of my children, I want her to love life, and I want her to be in love with herself even half as much as I am.",Non Depression

I’m in a wheelchair &amp; I ride around outside or in my room while listening to music with headphones &amp; I play out different unrealistic scenarios in my head &amp; it feels like it’s actually happening. For example, a scenario that I act out a lot is me singing a song (whatever song that fits how I feel or a deep meaningful song) that I pretend I wrote &amp; im “singing” in front of my entire college &amp; the person I’m thinking about while listening to music I pretend they’re in the audience &amp; I wrote the song about them. stuff like that. I’ll ride around for hours, playing out different scenarios. I grew up in a v abusive household so that’s what I’d do when they would be fighting. I’d pretend I’m somewhere else &amp; in the scenarios in my head, I’m not in a wheelchair. I can be/act out anything I want. I can be anywhere I wanna be. I’m not trapped. I don’t talk out loud, But sometimes I catch myself moving my mouth &amp; I’ll picture something funny or something funny would happen in the scenario &amp; I’d accidentally laugh bc I’m the funniest person I know lmao I’m sure besides my family, everyone else would think that’s so fuckin weird but it’s my coping mechanism tbh. 
I act out my dream scenarios that’ll never happen &amp; I’ll do it when I’m sad to get my mind off of it bc I can be anywhere or anyone I wanna be. In my head, my life is perfect. I look how I wish I looked. I have anyone I wanna have. I’ve done this my entire life &amp; im 20 &amp; I still do it. 
The best way i can think to describe it to where you might understand better: for example when you’re in the car as a kid &amp; you look out the window &amp; pretend you’re in a old R&amp;B music video 😂😭 that’s kinda how it is.

What do you think about this Thailand’s king political topic,"ANALYSIS—The Constitutional Court will rule on Friday on whether a 191.2 million baht loan to the Future Forward Party from its leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit breached the 2017 constitution's organic law on political parties.

The case hinges on whether the loan should be treated as income received by Future Forward. 

It is standard accounting practice all over the world that a loan is not regarded as income — it's a debt that must be repaid. So if the Constitution Court judges were fair and honest, the party and its leaders would be cleared of any wrongdoing.

However, the judges are widely know to be neither fair nor honest — the Constitution Court has made rulings that are frequently absurd, and which benefit the monarchy and military at the expense of pro-democracy parties.

The Thai regime has launched a heavy-handed campaign to destroy Future Forward, and according to several high-level sources, this has been directly ordered by King Vajiralongkorn.

The king is paranoid about the party, and the growing tendency especially among younger Thais to stand up for democracy and human rights and openly criticise the military and monarchy, especially on social media. 

Future Forward wants to build a democratic Thailand while Vajiralongkorn wants to drag the country back into the past to the days of absolute monarchy. The king wants the party crushed, and its leaders jailed or driven out of politics. 

Vajiralongkorn's close ally Apirat Kongsompong, the fanatically royalist army chief who the king plans to instal as prime minister once he is eligible in a few years, also hates Future Forward, which has called for the military to stay out of politics and for conscription to be abolished. 

In October, Apirat made a hysterical speech that directly attacked Thanathorn and Future Forward. He claimed that leftist academics, communists, corrupt politicians and evil foreigners were conspiring to destroy Thailand using techniques of ""hybrid warfare"" such a propaganda, sedition, protests, and misinformation including fake news.

Apirat's obsession with a communist threat showed how stuck in the past he remains, and his conspiracy theory is absurd — clearly it is the palace and the Thai regime that use propaganda, brainwashing and fake news to try to hold on to power and undermine democracy.

But with Vajiralongkorn and Apirat both determined to destroy Future Forward, and the royalist elite obediently obeying their wishes, the party's future looks bleak.

So there is a strong possibility that the judges will declare that Future Forward breached the law. If they rule that the loan was income or a donation, breaching article 66 of the political party law which put a 10 million baht limit on donations, all the party's executive members will be banned from politics for five years, decapitating the Future Forward leadership. The loan funds will be confiscated.

If the judges also rule that the loan was income via an illegal channel, in breach of article 72 of the political party law, then the Future Forward Party will be dissolved.

Even if the party survives Friday's ruling, the regime's attempts to crush it will continue. Future Forward and Thanathorn still face 28 more outstanding cases against them. 

Thanathorn has already been disqualified from being an MP in the current parliament by the Constitutional Court for allegedly owning shares in a media company, even though he showed evidence he had sold the shares. Meanwhile, 55 other MPs who may have shares in media companies have not even been suspended from parliament, in a blatant display of double standards. 

The Election Commission and Constitutional Court routinely rule against pro-democracy parties like Future Forward, Pheu Thai, and Thai Raksa Chart which was dissolved before it could even compete in last year's election.

The Election Commission took no action against Prayut Chan-ocha's junta party Palang Pracharat over a lavish banquet at which it raised 650 million baht — including donations from state agencies such as the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the Tourism Authority of Thailand, which is not allowed under the political party law.

The reason Future Forward needed the loan from Thanathorn in the first place was because of ridiculous rulings by the Election Commission designed to undermine the party and give Palang Pracharat an unfair advantage. 

The Commission registered Future Forward as a party on October 3, 2018. On October 6, the party opened for membership and fundraising. But on October 10 the Commission said no donations were allowed, and on November 14 it told the party no fundraising was allowed. 

This made it impossible for the party to prepare properly for the elections, because it had been deliberately starved of funds. So Thanathorn stepped in with a loan.

It was only on December 11, 2018, that political activities were allowed by the junta, and the election law was only published on January 23, 2019, just two months before the election. So parties like Future Forward were placed at a huge disadvantage, and Palang Pracharat had a massive head start in the election.

It's almost certain that Future Forward will be dissolved, if not on Friday then sometime before the next election. Thanathorn may end up in jail — something he predicted himself when he launched his brave effort to bring genuine democracy to Thailand.

But what Vajiralongkorn and Apirat don't understand is that Future Forward is not just a party. It's a movement, supported by millions of Thais sick of corruption, coups, and the antics of the king, who rules Thailand from Germany and Switzerland and squanders vast amounts of taxpayers' money. 

Destroying Future Forward will further polarise Thailand and eventually the military and monarchy will be kicked out of politics. However hard they try, Vajiralongkorn and his allies can't keep the country stuck in the past forever.",Non Depression

Dealing with Anxiety,"I’m in need of some serious help. Until recently, I believed anxiety to be almost non existent. Fake, to me. I’ve always had the nervous feeling in my stomach from doing certain things, but up until recently that’s about it. 

After suffering from some health issues I’ve been told by doctors that a lot of my symptoms now, are being caused by anxiety. I’m not sure how much truth there is to this because it’s not the type of anxiety I’m used to. Sometimes I’m feeling normal and I succumb to a weird feeling in the upper region of my chest that goes into my lower throat. It doesn’t feel like acid reflux and I’m not sure if it’s a heart palpitation or something else. Other than that, I deal with an increased heart rate a lot of the time and just feeling of unease. I would say that while experiencing what doctors would call one of my “anxiety triggers” I do sometimes experience panic attacks. 

I would like to know what some of you think and what I should do for a next step? I’ve tried a little bit of meditating, but it doesn’t feel like it helps me that much. Should I consider taking anxiety medication because that worries me that I’ll be pill dependent. Or would therapy or something be more beneficial? 

Thanks to everyone who replies.",Non Depression

"If someone were transported many years into the future, how accurately could they estimate the year?","Only through natural observation of the world, how accurately could we approximate the current year if dumped on a random day in the future? Could we somehow measure the level of some environmental value? Are there any astronomical observations one could make? How accurate can we get? Closest month? Closest day?

Obviously answers like 'ask someone the date' or 'look at a clock' don't count.",Non Depression

Weirdos? (Grammatically),"Would you agree that saying “you must think I’m a weirdo?” is a stronger and potentially more alarming sentence  than saying “you must think I’m some kind of weirdo?” 

Why does being “some kind of weirdo” seem more jovial and run-of-the-mill eccentric as oppose to being “a weirdo”, which makes me think of somebody that is peculiar to the point of concern? 

And linguistic rationale? 
Is this purely colloquial to my region? (Canada)
And I some kind of weirdo for thinking about this this hard?",Non Depression
